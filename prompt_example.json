Participants were 115 parents of children with ASD aged from 3 to 10\u00a0years. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the best predictors of parental stress among child-related, parent-related and environmental factors. Poor quality interactions within the extended family, high levels of expressed emotion and absence of children\u2019s schooling were associated with higher stress, regardless of the child\u2019s age and developmental quotient [F (3)\u00a0=\u00a037.051; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; Adj. R2\u00a0=\u00a00.457]. This study highlights the importance of considering environmental factors, specifically family variables, to understand parental stress. These key findings should be considered when designing support programs.\n\n==\n\nHerbert 2010:\n\nTitle: Contributions of the environment and environmentally vulnerable physiology to autism spectrum disorders\n\nAbstract: Purpose of reviewThis review presents a rationale and evidence for contributions of environmental influences and environmentally vulnerable physiology to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Recent findingsRecent studies suggest a substantial increase in ASD prevalence above earlier Centers for Disease Control figures of one in 150, only partly explicable by data artifacts, underscoring the possibility of environmental contributors to increased prevalence. Some gene variants in ASD confer altered vulnerability to environmental stressors and exposures. De-novo mutations and advanced parental age as a risk factor for ASD also suggest a role for environment. Systemic and central nervous system pathophysiology, including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction can be consistent with a role for environmental influence (e.g. from air pollution, organophosphates, heavy metals) in ASD, and some of the underlying biochemical disturbances (such as abnormalities in glutathione, a critical antioxidant and detoxifier) can be reversed by targeted nutritional interventions. Dietary factors and food contaminants may contribute risk. Improvement and loss of diagnosis in some with ASD suggest brain circuitry amenable to environmental modulation. SummaryPrevalence, genetic, exposure, and pathophysiological evidence all suggest a role for environmental factors in the inception and lifelong modulation of ASD. This supports the need for seeking targets for early and ongoing medical prevention and treatment of ASD.\n\n==\n\nDerguy 2018:\n\nTitle: An ecological exploration of individual, family, and environmental contributions to parental quality of life in autism\n\nAbstract: The aim of this study was to assess the respective weight of individual and environmental factors on quality of life (Qol) of parents of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Few studies have investigated both individual and environmental predictors of Qol but to our knowledge, none of them has considered the child's and parents' characteristics, family context and services available in the same design. Participants were 115 parents (73 mothers and 42 fathers) of children with ASD aged from 3 to 10 years. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to investigate predictors of parental Qol among child-related, parent-related and environmental factors. Findings indicate that a higher Qol is associated with a good quality of interaction in marital and parent-grandparents dyads, no family medical history and access to psycho-educational interventions for the child, regardless of child's developmental quotient, comorbidity, parent sex and working time. This final model best fits the data and explains 31.5% of the variance of parents' Qol. This study highlights that it is crucial to consider both individual and environmental variables as potential protective factors of parental adjustment. An ecological approach seems to be relevant to understand which parenting resources should be targeted in support programs.\n\n==\n\nConstant 2020:\n\nTitle: Precise Worlds for Certain Minds: An Ecological Perspective on the Relational Self in Autism\n\nAbstract: Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) presents a challenge to social and relational accounts of the self, precisely because it is broadly seen as a disorder impacting social relationships. Many influential theories argue that social deficits and impairments of the self are the core problems in ASC. Predictive processing approaches address these based on general purpose neurocognitive mechanisms that are expressed atypically. Here we use the High, Inflexible Precision of Prediction Errors in Autism approach in the context of cultural niche construction to explain atypicalities of the relational self, specifically its minimal, extended, and intersubjective aspects. We contend that the social self in ASC should not be seen as impaired, but rather as an outcome of atypical niche construction. We unpack the scientific, ethical, and practical consequences of this view, and discuss implications for how the challenges that autistic persons face should be approached.\n\n==\n\nHock 2012:\n\nTitle: Parent perceptions of autism severity: exploring the social ecological context.\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nHealth professionals incorporate parent reports into the diagnosis and treatment of children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet little is known about the contextual forces that may shape parents' perceptions of their child.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe current study seeks to: 1) compare the social ecological contexts of parents of children with ASD and parents of non-autistic children, and 2) explore the social ecological influences on parents' perception of their child's ASD severity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis study employed a cross-sectional analysis of data from the 2007-2008 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) in the United States. Social ecological factors of interest included variables depicting family physical environment, family social environment, and individual parent characteristics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nResults indicate that parents of children with ASD had increased odds of reporting poor neighborhood social capital, greater aggravation, more difficulty coping, and lower levels of relationship satisfaction and mental health. Parents' perceptions of their child's ASD severity were associated with several factors of their social ecological context. More severe parent-reported ASD was associated with aspects of the physical environment (rundown housing and garbage on the street), the social environment (parent relationship satisfaction) and individual parent characteristics (parent aggravation and mental health).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nResults suggest ways that professionals can contextualize parent reports to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of children with ASD. Findings also highlight a need for longitudinal research using well-characterized measures to determine the nature and direction of relationships between contextual factors and parents' perceptions.\n\n==\n\nReszka 2012:\n\nTitle: Ecological Features of Preschools and the Social Engagement of Children With Autism\n\nAbstract: One way to support the social engagement of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is by identifying features of natural environments that increase the likelihood of social interaction. This descriptive study was an examination of the (a) social engagement of 68 preschoolers with ASD in classrooms, (b) ecological features of classrooms that promoted social engagement, and (c) relationships between social engagement and ecological features using the Code for Active Student Participation and Engagement\u2013Revised, an ecobehavioral observational system. Overall, children without ASD were most likely to be socially engaged with peers in the Books and Food/Snack classroom areas, when participating in book or large motor behaviors, in small groups with peers or large groups with an adult, and during child-initiated activities. Implications for practice and future research are highlighted.\n\n==\n\nCrespi 2008:\n\nTitle: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain.\n\nAbstract: Autistic-spectrum conditions and psychotic-spectrum conditions (mainly schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression) represent two major suites of disorders of human cognition, affect, and behavior that involve altered development and function of the social brain. We describe evidence that a large set of phenotypic traits exhibit diametrically opposite phenotypes in autistic-spectrum versus psychotic-spectrum conditions, with a focus on schizophrenia. This suite of traits is inter-correlated, in that autism involves a general pattern of constrained overgrowth, whereas schizophrenia involves undergrowth. These disorders also exhibit diametric patterns for traits related to social brain development, including aspects of gaze, agency, social cognition, local versus global processing, language, and behavior. Social cognition is thus underdeveloped in autistic-spectrum conditions and hyper-developed on the psychotic spectrum.;>We propose and evaluate a novel hypothesis that may help to explain these diametric phenotypes: that the development of these two sets of conditions is mediated in part by alterations of genomic imprinting. Evidence regarding the genetic, physiological, neurological, and psychological underpinnings of psychotic-spectrum conditions supports the hypothesis that the etiologies of these conditions involve biases towards increased relative effects from imprinted genes with maternal expression, which engender a general pattern of undergrowth. By contrast, autistic-spectrum conditions appear to involve increased relative bias towards effects of paternally expressed genes, which mediate overgrowth. This hypothesis provides a simple yet comprehensive theory, grounded in evolutionary biology and genetics, for understanding the causes and phenotypes of autistic-spectrum and psychotic-spectrum conditions.\n\n==\n\n\u00d6zbaran 2014:\n\nTitle: Do Environmental Factors Have Influence on Autism Spectrum Disorder\n\nAbstract: Ya z\u203afl ma Ad re si/Ad dress for Cor res pon den ce Dr. Burcu \u00d6zbaran, Ege \u00dcniversitesi T\u0131p Fak\u00fcltesi, \u00c7ocuk ve Ergen Psikiyatrisi Anabilim Dal\u0131, \u0130zmir, T\u00fcrkiye Tel.: +90 532 791 97 51 E-posta: drbbeker@yahoo.com Ge li\u015f ta ri hi/Re cei ved: 17.06.2014 Ka bul ta ri hi/ Ac cep ted: 15.07.2014 Ege \u00dcniversitesi T\u0131p Fak\u00fcltesi, \u00c7ocuk ve Ergen Psikiyatrisi Anabilim Dal\u0131, \u0130zmir, T\u00fcrkiye Burcu \u00d6zbaran The Journal of Pediatric Research 2014;1(4):170-3 DO I: 10.4274/jpr.44153\n\nWrite a summary of what the papers collectively say about the research question.\n\nYou must cite the papers in your summary.
