This literature accuses science journalists of inaccuracy, sensationalism, oversimplification and failing to engage audiences in meaningful debate about scientific issues. However, research has yet to offer concrete solutions to journalists that connect theory to practice in an effort to counter these criticisms. In this paper, we approach this gap through the development of clearly articulated models of science journalism that are supported by theoretical considerations of the varying purposes of science communication, and then, importantly, tied to practical story development criteria. Four models are presented: science literacy, contextual, lay-expertise and public participation. These models are clear representations of how science journalism can be produced from within different theoretical frameworks and thereby provide a theoretically-informed but practical guide for nuanced evaluations of the quality of science journalism.\n\n==\n\nVadapalli 2018:\n\nTitle: Sci-Blogger: A Step Towards Automated Science Journalism\n\nAbstract: Science journalism is the art of conveying a detailed scientific research paper in a form that non-scientists can understand and appreciate while ensuring that its underlying information is conveyed accurately. It plays a crucial role in making scientific content suitable for consumption by the public at large. In this work, we introduce the problem of automating some parts of the science journalism workflow by automatically generating the 'title' of a blog version of a scientific paper. We have built a corpus of $87,328$ pairs of research papers and their corresponding blogs from two science news aggregators and have used it to buildSci ence-Blogger - a pipeline-based architecture consisting of a two-stage mechanism to generate the blog titles. Evaluation using standard metrics indicate viability of the proposed system.\n\n==\n\nFahy 2011:\n\nTitle: The science journalist online: Shifting roles and emerging practices\n\nAbstract: Science reporters today work within an evolving science media ecosystem that is pluralistic, participatory and social. It is a mostly online environment that has challenged the historically dominant and exceptional role of science reporters as privileged conveyers of specialist information to general audiences. We map this science media environment, drawing on interviews with journalists and writers from nationally prominent US and UK media organizations, describing the shifting roles and emerging practices of science journalists online. Compared to a decade ago, this occupational group, driven by economic imperatives and technological changes, is performing a wider plurality of roles, including those of curator, convener, public intellectual and civic educator, in addition to more traditional journalistic roles of reporter, conduit, watchdog and agenda-setter. Online science journalists have a more collaborative relationship with their audiences and sources and are generally adopting a more critical and interpretative stance towards the scientific community, industry, and policy-oriented organizations.\n\n==\n\nAllan 2011:\n\nTitle: Introduction: Science Journalism in a Digital Age\n\nAbstract: The people who run the media are humanities graduates with little understanding of science, who wear their ignorance as a badge of honour. Secretly, deep down, perhaps they resent the fact that they have denied themselves access to the most significant developments in the history of Western thought from the past 200 years; but there is an attack implicit in all media coverage of science: in their choice of stories, and the way they cover them, the media create a parody of science. On this template, science is portrayed as groundless, incomprehensible, didactic truth statements from scientists, who themselves are socially powerful, arbitrary, unelected authority figures. They are detached from reality; they do work that is either whacky or dangerous, but either way, everything in science is tenuous, contradictory, probably going to change soon and, most ridiculously, \u2018hard to understand.\u2019 Having created this parody, the commentariat then attack it, as if they were genuinely critiquing what science is all about.

Scripps and William E. Ritter joined to form a science news organization dedicated to pioneering the dissemination of accurate, accessible, and engaging news of science to the public primarily through the mainstream media. Scripps, a longtime journalist and successful entrepreneur, and Ritter, a respected biologist and teacher, were convinced of the importance of science knowledge to the American public. They also were concerned about limits and abuses under other political systems where science research was abridged or threatened. They sought to create a \"scientific habit of mind\" among the general public to increase the average person's awareness of the role of science in his or her daily life, to gain support for science research, and to help protect American democracy through an intelligent\u2014meaning scienceeducated\u2014citizenry. The result of this collaboration was the organization Science Service, established in 1921 for the popularization of science, with the support and participation of the leading science organizations, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, National Academy of Science, and the National Research Council, as well as leaders of the journalism community. Reaching the public also meant navigating the contentious relationship between scientists and the press to create new ways of translating science information, and overcoming scientists' reticence about sharing their research interests with the lay public. Additionally, Science Service weighed capturing the public's attention through enticing but only fact-tinged stories, versus adhering to higher scientific and journalistic standards of fact-based but less sensational articles. Through the post-war twenties, the Depression thirties, and the war-plagued forties, Science Service forged relationships with\n\n==\n\nNisbet 2015:\n\nTitle: The Need for Knowledge-Based Journalism in Politicized Science Debates\n\nAbstract: Largely overlooked by researchers studying the science of science communication are the specific journalistic practices and media structures that might enable more constructive public debate in politicized science controversies. In this commentary, we discuss the role that journalists can play as influential knowledge professionals, drawing on insights from the studies in this section of the special issue. In doing so, we outline three complementary approaches to what Thomas Patterson calls \u201cknowledge-based journalism.\u201d By way of these approaches, journalists and their news organizations can contextualize and critically evaluate expert knowledge; facilitate discussion that bridges entrenched ideological divisions; and promote consideration of a broader menu of policy options and technologies. We conclude by discussing the implications for journalism education.\n\n==\n\nGuenther 2017:\n\nTitle: Scientific Evidence and Science Journalism\n\nAbstract: Science journalism in print and online media is an important source of information for laypersons. While science journalists established their own professional routines and standards, different actors (and scientists in particular) often criticise science journalism for not being transparent and accurate enough. One critical point raised concerns journalists\u2019 representation of scientific evidence. Against this background, the current study investigated which kind of information about scientific evidence is represented in science articles in German print and online media. The results of a quantitative content analysis (N\u2009=\u2009128), in which variables were coded for the represented scientific results (N\u2009=\u2009225), showed that scientific evidence is rarely part of science articles, and scientific findings are predominantly depicted as scientifically certain. However, information about uncertainty is more common within sections in the media specifically dedicated to science, as well as when the article has natural scientific or medical scientific content. In addition, the scientific results that are presented first in an article contain the most information about scientific evidence.\n\n==\n\nPolman 2014:\n\nTitle: Adapting Practices of Science Journalism to Foster Science Literacy\n\nAbstract: In this paper, the authors describe how the practices of expert science journalists enable them to act as \u201ccompetent outsiders\u201d to science. We assert that selected science journalism practices can be used to design reform-based science instruction; these practices not only foster science literacy that is useful in daily life, but also complement practices of scientists that already have been incorporated into science education. We describe and illustrate science journalism practices for educational activities that can be adapted and used. We argue that such experiences enable students to better use science information for personal decision-making and help them contribute meaningfully to public discourse long after high school graduation. Finally, we describe the design of a learning environment that facilitates research and development based on this model.\n\nWrite a summary of what the papers collectively say about the research question.\n\nYou must cite the papers in your summary.
