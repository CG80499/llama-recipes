{"prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: I need you to help me summarize academic papers. Our research question is \"Autoimmune disease\".\n\nI've collected many papers that might address this research question.\n\nPanayi 1976:\n\nTitle: Auto-immune disease.\n\nAbstract: Auto-immune disease may result from the interaction of the genetic load of the individual, modification of self-tissue antigens by environmental agents such as virus or drugs and abnormalities of the immunological system itself such as the loss of controlling or suppressor T cells with age. In the majority of people the outcome is tolerance, maintenance of normal tissue architecture and function. In the unfortunate few the outcome is auto-immune disease, that is, failure to recognize \"self\".\n\n==\n\nDavidson 2014:\n\nTitle: General Features of Autoimmune Disease\n\nAbstract: Abstract Autoimmune diseases are common diseases in which loss of tolerance within the immune system results in pathologic immune responses that target either cellular or organ-specific self-antigens. There is a genetic tendency toward autoreactivity in affected individuals, and both innate and adaptive immune activation may contribute to disease. An important recent advance is the identification of genetic polymorphisms that contribute to risk in most autoimmune diseases and are associated with a variety of immune activation pathways; these associations have been informative about disease-specific pathogenesis and have led to the development of successful therapies for some diseases. A deeper understanding of the components of the innate and adaptive immune system has led to highly effective therapeutic targeting of cytokines, cell surface molecules, and intracellular signaling molecules with marked improvements in outcome in several autoimmune diseases. Fertile new avenues for research include mechanisms of regulation by regulatory immune cells, metabolic regulation of immune cell function, and immune activation by commensal bacteria that colonize humans. The goal of regulating autoimmunity without causing excessive immunosuppression remains elusive but is the holy grail of current research efforts.\n\n==\n\nBaker 1997:\n\nTitle: Autoimmune endocrine disease.\n\nAbstract: Autoimmune endocrine diseases are serious disorders that utilize immense health care resources and cause tremendous disability. They include type 1 diabetes mellitus, thyroiditis, Graves disease, Addison disease, and polyglandular syndromes. Analysis of the basis of autoimmune diseases has been aided by the application of new knowledge in immunologic physiology. Recent investigations using these techniques have revealed complicated disorders that have varied pathogenesis and complex genetic predispositions. While the mainstay of treatment for these diverse diseases remains the replacement of hormones produced by the damaged endocrine organ, investigations into the pathogenesis of these disorders provide hope for the development of specific therapeutic measures to block their pathologic basis.\n\n==\n\nKing 1963:\n\nTitle: Autoimmune diseases; pathogenesis, chemistry and therapy.\n\nAbstract: Medical scientists, meeting the challenge of socalled \"autoimmune\" diseases, have created new techniques and achieved new concepts which are altering markedly our outlook in immunology, immunochemistry, and pathology. Burnet, winner of the Nobel prize for medicine, collaborates with Mackay to present an exposition of this field. They discuss a group of diseases \"for which an autoimmune etiology has been established either as a primary or an associated factor, or in which there is some likelihood that autoimmune processes are concerned.\" Analyzed at length are thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosis, certain hemolytic conditions, rheumatoid arthritis, glomerulonephritis, and certain liver and nervous system diseases, while numerous other conditions are treated more cursorily. To diagnose an autoimmune state the authors invoke the following criteria: an increase in gamma globulin, demonstrable autoantibodies against some body component, deposition of denatured gamma globulin at certain sites of elections, accumulation of lymphocytes and plasma cells, some degree of\n\n==\n\nSinha 1990:\n\nTitle: Autoimmune diseases: the failure of self tolerance.\n\nAbstract: The ability to discriminate between self and nonself antigens is vital to the functioning of the immune system as a specific defense against invading microorganisms. Failure of the immune system to \"tolerate\" self tissues can result in pathological autoimmune states leading to debilitating illness and sometimes death. The induction of autoimmunity involves genetic and environmental factors that have focused the attention of researchers on the trimolecular complex formed by major histocompatibility complex molecules, antigen, and T cell receptors. Detailed molecular characterization of these components points to potential strategies for disease intervention.\n\n==\n\nAsherson 1967:\n\nTitle: Growing Points: Autoimmune Disease\u2014I\n\nAbstract: In some human diseases antibodies react with human tissue in vitro. These antibodies are called autoantibodies, and are found in rheumatic fever, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other diseases. The presence of autoantibodies is compatible with the view that tissues are damaged by an autoimmune process directed against components of the patient's own tissues. For this reason Hashimoto's thyroiditis and systemic lupus erythematosus are called putative autoimmune diseases. For readers wishing to learn more about autoimmunity the recent books by Humphrey and White (1964) and Glynn and Holborow (1965) are recommended. The bibliography for the statements made in this article is given by Asherson (1965).\n\n==\n\nAgarwal 2009:\n\nTitle: Autoimmunity in common variable immunodeficiency\n\nAbstract: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common clinically significant primary immune defect. Although the hallmark of CVID is hypogammaglobulinemia, the intrinsic dysregulation of the immune system leads to defective T-cell activation and proliferation, as well as dendritic cell and cytokine defects. Although 70% to 80% of patients have had recurrent sinopulmonary infections, autoimmunity and inflammatory complications are also common. The most common autoimmune conditions are immune thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic anemia, but other autoimmune complications arise, including rheumatoid arthritis, pernicious anemia, primary biliary cirrhosis, thyroiditis, sicca syndrome, systemic lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease. Treatment of autoimmunity includes highdose immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, selected immu no suppressants, and other immune modulators. This review focuses on autoimmune conditions associated with CVID, potential mechanisms of immune dysregulation, and therapeutic strategies.\n\n==\n\nKatsorida 2001:\n\nTitle: Autoimmunity and autoimmune disease.\n\nAbstract: A disease is defined as autoimmune if the tissue damage is caused by an adaptive immune response to self-antigen. Development of the disease by transferring the active component of the immune response to an appropriate recipient is the best proof that the disease is caused by autoimmunity. The body contains large numbers of potentially autoreactive B and T cells, although there are a variety of mechanisms operating to establish self-tolerance during lymphocyte development. This is particularly true for thymic T cells that are not deleted by selfepitopes. The presence of autoreactive B cells in the normal population is well demonstrated by the development of autoantibodies when autoantigens are injected with adjuvants in normal animals (e.g. anti-thyroglobulin). Existence of autoreactive T cells in normal individuals is demonstrated by the production of autoimmune lines of T cells when normal circulating T cells are stimulated by the appropriate autoantigen (e.g. myelin basic protein) and interleukin-2. Autoimmune disease can be classified as organ specific, when the response is primarily against antigens localized to particular organs or as non-organ specific, when the response is directed against widespread antigens. Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis and SLE represent the extremes of autoimmune disease spectrum. In organ specific diseases, the thyroid, adrenals, stomach, and pancreas are the usual target organs. The non-organ specific diseases, which include the rheumatic disorders, characteristically involve the skin, kidney, brain, lungs, joints, and muscles w1x.\n\nWrite a summary of what the papers collectively say about the research question.\n\nYou must cite the papers in your summary.

ASSISTANT: Here is a fully complete concise summary in varied and engaging language of everything all the papers have to say on the research question \"Autoimmune disease\".\n\n", "output": "The papers suggest that autoimmune diseases result from a loss of self-tolerance within the immune system (Panayi 1976). These diseases involve the immune system targeting self-antigens, leading to tissue damage and dysfunction (Davidson 2014). Genetic factors and environmental triggers, such as viruses or drugs, may contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases (Panayi 1976). Autoimmune endocrine diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and thyroiditis, have complex pathogenesis and genetic predispositions (Baker 1997). Autoantibodies and autoreactive immune cells play a role in the development of autoimmune diseases (Sinha 1990; Katsorida 2001). While autoimmune diseases can affect specific organs or be non-organ specific, they can cause significant disability and require hormone replacement therapy (Baker 1997; Katsorida 2001). Autoimmunity can coexist with primary immune defects, such as common variable immunodeficiency, leading to both recurrent infections and autoimmune complications (Agarwal 2009). Understanding the mechanisms of immune dysregulation and developing targeted therapies remain areas of ongoing research (Davidson 2014; Agarwal 2009)."}
