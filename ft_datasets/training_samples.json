There is a genetic tendency toward autoreactivity in affected individuals, and both innate and adaptive immune activation may contribute to disease. An important recent advance is the identification of genetic polymorphisms that contribute to risk in most autoimmune diseases and are associated with a variety of immune activation pathways; these associations have been informative about disease-specific pathogenesis and have led to the development of successful therapies for some diseases. A deeper understanding of the components of the innate and adaptive immune system has led to highly effective therapeutic targeting of cytokines, cell surface molecules, and intracellular signaling molecules with marked improvements in outcome in several autoimmune diseases. Fertile new avenues for research include mechanisms of regulation by regulatory immune cells, metabolic regulation of immune cell function, and immune activation by commensal bacteria that colonize humans. The goal of regulating autoimmunity without causing excessive immunosuppression remains elusive but is the holy grail of current research efforts.\n\n==\n\nBaker 1997:\n\nTitle: Autoimmune endocrine disease.\n\nAbstract: Autoimmune endocrine diseases are serious disorders that utilize immense health care resources and cause tremendous disability. They include type 1 diabetes mellitus, thyroiditis, Graves disease, Addison disease, and polyglandular syndromes. Analysis of the basis of autoimmune diseases has been aided by the application of new knowledge in immunologic physiology. Recent investigations using these techniques have revealed complicated disorders that have varied pathogenesis and complex genetic predispositions. While the mainstay of treatment for these diverse diseases remains the replacement of hormones produced by the damaged endocrine organ, investigations into the pathogenesis of these disorders provide hope for the development of specific therapeutic measures to block their pathologic basis.\n\n==\n\nKing 1963:\n\nTitle: Autoimmune diseases; pathogenesis, chemistry and therapy.\n\nAbstract: Medical scientists, meeting the challenge of socalled \"autoimmune\" diseases, have created new techniques and achieved new concepts which are altering markedly our outlook in immunology, immunochemistry, and pathology.

They discuss a group of diseases \"for which an autoimmune etiology has been established either as a primary or an associated factor, or in which there is some likelihood that autoimmune processes are concerned.\" Analyzed at length are thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosis, certain hemolytic conditions, rheumatoid arthritis, glomerulonephritis, and certain liver and nervous system diseases, while numerous other conditions are treated more cursorily.

Failure of the immune system to \"tolerate\" self tissues can result in pathological autoimmune states leading to debilitating illness and sometimes death. The induction of autoimmunity involves genetic and environmental factors that have focused the attention of researchers on the trimolecular complex formed by major histocompatibility complex molecules, antigen, and T cell receptors.

These antibodies are called autoantibodies, and are found in rheumatic fever, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other diseases. The presence of autoantibodies is compatible with the view that tissues are damaged by an autoimmune process directed against components of the patient's own tissues. For this reason Hashimoto's thyroiditis and systemic lupus erythematosus are called putative autoimmune diseases. For readers wishing to learn more about autoimmunity the recent books by Humphrey and White (1964) and Glynn and Holborow (1965) are recommended.

Although the hallmark of CVID is hypogammaglobulinemia, the intrinsic dysregulation of the immune system leads to defective T-cell activation and proliferation, as well as dendritic cell and cytokine defects. Although 70% to 80% of patients have had recurrent sinopulmonary infections, autoimmunity and inflammatory complications are also common. The most common autoimmune conditions are immune thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic anemia, but other autoimmune complications arise, including rheumatoid arthritis, pernicious anemia, primary biliary cirrhosis, thyroiditis, sicca syndrome, systemic lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease. Treatment of autoimmunity includes highdose immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, selected immu no suppressants, and other immune modulators. This review focuses on autoimmune conditions associated with CVID, potential mechanisms of immune dysregulation, and therapeutic strategies.\n\n==\n\nKatsorida 2001:\n\nTitle: Autoimmunity and autoimmune disease.\n\nAbstract: A disease is defined as autoimmune if the tissue damage is caused by an adaptive immune response to self-antigen. Development of the disease by transferring the active component of the immune response to an appropriate recipient is the best proof that the disease is caused by autoimmunity. The body contains large numbers of potentially autoreactive B and T cells, although there are a variety of mechanisms operating to establish self-tolerance during lymphocyte development. This is particularly true for thymic T cells that are not deleted by selfepitopes. The presence of autoreactive B cells in the normal population is well demonstrated by the development of autoantibodies when autoantigens are injected with adjuvants in normal animals (e.g. anti-thyroglobulin). Existence of autoreactive T cells in normal individuals is demonstrated by the production of autoimmune lines of T cells when normal circulating T cells are stimulated by the appropriate autoantigen (e.g. myelin basic protein) and interleukin-2. Autoimmune disease can be classified as organ specific, when the response is primarily against antigens localized to particular organs or as non-organ specific, when the response is directed against widespread antigens. Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis and SLE represent the extremes of autoimmune disease spectrum. In organ specific diseases, the thyroid, adrenals, stomach, and pancreas are the usual target organs. The non-organ specific diseases, which include the rheumatic disorders, characteristically involve the skin, kidney, brain, lungs, joints, and muscles w1x.", "final_summary": "Autoimmune diseases are complex conditions where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells, viewing them as foreign invaders. These diseases result from a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors, leading to a loss of immune tolerance to self-antigens (Panayi, 1976; Davidson, 2014; Baker, 1997; Sinha, 1990). \n\nThe pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases is multifaceted and involves both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Genetic polymorphisms associated with immune activation pathways contribute to the risk of developing these diseases (Davidson, 2014). The interaction of major histocompatibility complex molecules, antigen, and T cell receptors is a focal point in the induction of autoimmunity (Sinha, 1990). \n\nAutoimmune diseases can be organ-specific, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, where the immune response primarily targets specific organs, or non-organ specific, like systemic lupus erythematosus, where the immune response is directed against widespread antigens (Katsorida, 2001). \n\nAutoimmune endocrine diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus and Graves disease, are serious disorders that cause significant disability and utilize immense health care resources (Baker, 1997). Autoimmunity is also associated with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), a primary immune defect that leads to defective T-cell activation and proliferation (Agarwal, 2009). \n\nIn conclusion, autoimmune diseases are a result of the immune system's failure to recognize \"self,\" leading to pathologic immune responses. These diseases are complex, involving genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and immune system dysregulation. They can be organ-specific or non-organ specific and are associated with significant morbidity and healthcare utilization.

In the twenty years since the first imprinted gene was identified, this model has had a significant impact on decoding epigenetic information in mammals. So far it has led to the discovery of long-range cis-acting control elements whose epigenetic state regulates small clusters of genes and of unusual macro noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that directly repress genes in cis, and critically, it has demonstrated that one biological role of DNA methylation is to allow expression of genes normally repressed by default. This review describes the progress in understanding how imprinted protein-coding genes are silenced; in particular, it focuses on the role of macro ncRNAs that have broad relevance as a potential new layer of regulatory information in the mammalian genome.\n\n==\n\nBartolomei 2009:\n\nTitle: Genomic imprinting: employing and avoiding epigenetic processes.\n\nAbstract: Genomic imprinting refers to an epigenetic mark that distinguishes parental alleles and results in a monoallelic, parental-specific expression pattern in mammals. Few phenomena in nature depend more on epigenetic mechanisms while at the same time evading them. The alleles of imprinted genes are marked epigenetically at discrete elements termed imprinting control regions (ICRs) with their parental origin in gametes through the use of DNA methylation, at the very least. Imprinted gene expression is subsequently maintained using noncoding RNAs, histone modifications, insulators, and higher-order chromatin structure. Avoidance is manifest when imprinted genes evade the genome-wide reprogramming that occurs after fertilization and remain marked with their parental origin. This review summarizes what is known about the establishment and maintenance of imprinting marks and discusses the mechanisms of imprinting in clusters. Additionally, the evolution of imprinted gene clusters is described.

In particular, many principles of the epigenetic control of genome function have been uncovered by studies of genomic imprinting. The phenomenon of genomic imprinting, which results in some genes being expressed in a parental--origin-specific manner, is essential for normal mammalian growth and development and exemplifies the regulatory influences of DNA methylation, chromatin structure and non-coding RNA. Setting seminal discoveries in this field alongside recent progress and remaining questions shows how the study of imprinting continues to enhance our understanding of the epigenetic control of genome function in other contexts.\n\n==\n\nHall 1997:\n\nTitle: Genomic imprinting: nature and clinical relevance.\n\nAbstract: Molecular genetic techniques allow investigators to trace chromosomes and genes from parent to child and, in a single individual, from tissue to tissue. These techniques have uncovered a new type of gene control in which the allele from one parent is expressed and the allele from the other parent is not. This differential expression is called genomic imprinting. It may lead to phenotypic differences when inheritance is from the mother versus the father. Genomic imprinting has been observed in a number of disorders having to do with growth, behavior, and abnormal cell growth. It is important to be aware that such a phenomenon exists and to consider it when making diagnoses and determining therapy.\n\n==\n\nReik 2001:\n\nTitle: Genomic imprinting: parental influence on the genome\n\nAbstract: Genomic imprinting affects several dozen mammalian genes and results in the expression of those genes from only one of the two parental chromosomes. This is brought about by epigenetic instructions \u2014 imprints \u2014 that are laid down in the parental germ cells. Imprinting is a particularly important genetic mechanism in mammals, and is thought to influence the transfer of nutrients to the fetus and the newborn from the mother. Consistent with this view is the fact that imprinted genes tend to affect growth in the womb and behaviour after birth. Aberrant imprinting disturbs development and is the cause of various disease syndromes. The study of imprinting also provides new insights into epigenetic gene modification during development.\n\n==\n\nBarlow 2014:\n\nTitle: Genomic imprinting in mammals.\n\nAbstract: Genomic imprinting affects a subset of genes in mammals and results in a monoallelic, parental-specific expression pattern. Most of these genes are located in clusters that are regulated through the use of insulators or long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). To distinguish the parental alleles, imprinted genes are epigenetically marked in gametes at imprinting control elements through the use of DNA methylation at the very least. Imprinted gene expression is subsequently conferred through lncRNAs, histone modifications, insulators, and higher-order chromatin structure. Such imprints are maintained after fertilization through these mechanisms despite extensive reprogramming of the mammalian genome.

Several common features emerged from comparative analysis of four imprinted domains in mice and humans: (a) Certain genes appear to be imprinted by secondary events, possibly indicating a lack of gene-specific imprinting marks; (b) some genes appear to resist silencing, predicting the presence of cis-elements that oppose domain-specific imprinting control; (c) the nature of the imprinting mark remains incompletely understood. In addition, common silencing mechanisms are employed by the various imprinting domains, including silencer elements that nucleate and propagate a silent chromatin state, insulator elements that prevent promoter-enhancer interactions when hypomethylated on one parental allele, and antisense RNAs that function in silencing the overlapping sense gene and more distantly located genes. These commonalities are reminiscent of the behavior of genes subjected to, and the mechanisms employed in, dosage compensation.", "final_summary": "Genomic imprinting, an intriguing epigenetic phenomenon, results in the monoallelic, parent-specific expression of certain genes, a deviation from the traditional Mendelian inheritance (Falls, 1999; Barlow, 2011; Bartolomei, 2009; Ferguson-Smith, 2011; Hall, 1997; Reik, 2001; Barlow, 2014; Verona, 2003).

The medulla and cortex of the lung are structurally different, and there are convincing reasons to assume nonuniformity of ventilation between them. Radiologic evidence shows that the cortex participates in the ventilatory play to a greater extent than the medulla; being readily distensible, it provides probably the greatest part of the ventilatory volume changes at rest. Lymphatic drainage, dependent on movements of the adjacent structures, is greatly promoted in the well ventilated parts, and the poorly moving central parts (medulla) seem to have a sluggish lymph flow. This would explain the frequently encountered preference of pulmonary edema for the central part of the lung or individual lobe. The involved central wet portion is occasionally set off abruptly from the dry cortex, because of the sharp morphologic and functional demarcation between medulla and cortex. The appearance of this demarcation is obviously dependent on factors of ventilation, perfusion, and others. It is, therefore, usually transient in cardiovascular edema.\n\n==\n\nGluecker 1999:\n\nTitle: Clinical and radiologic features of pulmonary edema.\n\nAbstract: Pulmonary edema may be classified as increased hydrostatic pressure edema, permeability edema with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), permeability edema without DAD, or mixed edema. Pulmonary edema has variable manifestations. Postobstructive pulmonary edema typically manifests radiologically as septal lines, peribronchial cuffing, and, in more severe cases, central alveolar edema. Pulmonary edema with chronic pulmonary embolism manifests as sharply demarcated areas of increased ground-glass attenuation. Pulmonary edema with veno-occlusive disease manifests as large pulmonary arteries, diffuse interstitial edema with numerous Kerley lines, peribronchial cuffing, and a dilated right ventricle. Stage 1 near drowning pulmonary edema manifests as Kerley lines, peribronchial cuffing, and patchy, perihilar alveolar areas of airspace consolidation; stage 2 and 3 lesions are radiologically nonspecific. Pulmonary edema following administration of cytokines demonstrates bilateral, symmetric interstitial edema with thickened septal lines. High-altitude pulmonary edema usually manifests as central interstitial edema associated with peribronchial cuffing, ill-defined vessels, and patchy airspace consolidation. Neurogenic pulmonary edema manifests as bilateral, rather homogeneous airspace consolidations that predominate at the apices in about 50% of cases. Reperfusion pulmonary edema usually demonstrates heterogeneous airspace consolidations that predominate in the areas distal to the recanalized vessels. Postreduction pulmonary edema manifests as mild airspace consolidation involving the ipsilateral lung, whereas pulmonary edema due to air embolism initially demonstrates interstitial edema followed by bilateral, peripheral alveolar areas of increased opacity that predominate at the lung bases. Familiarity with the spectrum of radiologic findings in pulmonary edema from various causes will often help narrow the differential diagnosis.\n\n==\n\nB\u00e4rtsch 2005:\n\nTitle: Physiological aspects of high-altitude pulmonary edema.\n\nAbstract: High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) develops in rapidly ascending nonacclimatized healthy individuals at altitudes above 3,000 m. An excessive rise in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) preceding edema formation is the crucial pathophysiological factor because drugs that lower PAP prevent HAPE. Measurements of nitric oxide (NO) in exhaled air, of nitrites and nitrates in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and forearm NO-dependent endothelial function all point to a reduced NO availability in hypoxia as a major cause of the excessive hypoxic PAP rise in HAPE-susceptible individuals. Studies using right heart catheterization or BAL in incipient HAPE have demonstrated that edema is caused by an increased microvascular hydrostatic pressure in the presence of normal left atrial pressure, resulting in leakage of large-molecular-weight proteins and erythrocytes across the alveolarcapillary barrier in the absence of any evidence of inflammation. These studies confirm in humans that high capillary pressure induces a high-permeability-type lung edema in the absence of inflammation, a concept first introduced under the term \"stress failure.\" Recent studies using microspheres in swine and magnetic resonance imaging in humans strongly support the concept and primacy of nonuniform hypoxic arteriolar vasoconstriction to explain how hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction occurring predominantly at the arteriolar level can cause leakage. This compelling but as yet unproven mechanism predicts that edema occurs in areas of high blood flow due to lesser vasoconstriction. The combination of high flow at higher pressure results in pressures, which exceed the structural and dynamic capacity of the alveolar capillary barrier to maintain normal alveolar fluid balance.\n\n==\n\nDenomme 1988:\n\nTitle: Pulmonary edema.\n\nAbstract: Pulmonary edema is the accumulation of fluids in the interstitium and alveoli of the lung. There are two main basic mechanisms for edema development: increased hydrostatic pressure in the lung capillaries (\u201chigh-pressure edema\u201d) and increase vascular permeability (\u201clow-pressure edema). This classification helps understand the basic pathophysiological differences between the two types of pulmonary edema, but has limitations. Disruption of some or all layers of the alveolar-capillary unit occurs during elevated capillary hydrostatic pressures, a phenomenon termed \u201cpulmonary capillary stress failure\u201d. Pulmonary capillary stress failure represents a process that blurs the distinction between high-pressure and low-pressure pulmonary edema, as the disruption of the alveolar-capillary membrane by high hydrostatic pressures may render it more permeable to fluid and proteins. The resulting edema fluid has a higher concentration of protein than would be expected in conventional high-pressure pulmonary edema.

There are specific signs of interstitial edema, such as septal lines and peribronchial and perivascular cuffing. but others, such as perihilar haze, can be confused with intra-alveolar edema.4.

The pathogenesis believed to be responsible for this condition is the vector of blood flow from the left ventricle to left atrium, which may be targeted at the right superior pulmonary vein, locally accentuating the forces for edema formation in the right upper lobe. Pulmonary edema accompanying mitral regurgitation should be suspected whenever right upper lobe consolidation develops in a patient with known or suspected mitral valve disease.

Postanesthetic laryngospasm is the most common cause of pulmonary edema in adults (11/26 cases). The edema usually clears rapidly with supportive care.

Several antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT), counteract oxidative damage and constitute a primary defense against oxidative stress. GPX is a soluble selenoprotein that reduces H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides to H2O, and GPX1 is the most abundant and ubiquitous intracellular isoform [1]. GPX1 activity is not strongly affected by UV and is considered to be the most important antioxidant enzyme defense mechanism in the skin [2]. CAT is a heme enzyme that neutralizes reactive oxygen species by converting H2O2 to H2O and O2. CAT activity in the skin is significantly reduced after exposure to UV [2], which suggests its effect may be prone to effect modification by environmental factors. \n \nInherited variants in the encoding genes that affect the activity or expression of these antioxidant enzymes are hypothesized to modulate oxidative stress and thus influence skin cancer risk. A polymorphism in the GPX1 gene (Pro198Leu, rs1050450) and a polymorphism in the promoter region of the CAT gene (C-262T, rs1001179) have been shown to be associated with lower enzyme activities of their encoded enzymes [3, 4]. To test our main hypothesis that these two genetic polymorphisms are associated with skin cancer risk, we conducted a nested case-control study of Caucasians (218 melanoma, 285 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 300 basal cell carcinoma (BCC) cases, and 870 age-matched controls) within the Nurses\u2019 Health Study. We further investigated potential gene-environment interactions between these polymorphisms and lifestyle factors such as dietary antioxidant intake and sun exposure related risk factors. A detailed description of the characteristics of cases and controls was published previously [5]. Information on dietary intake was collected prospectively by food-frequency questionnaires, and total-energy-adjusted cumulative average of dietary intake was used to reduce within-person variation and represent long-term dietary intake [6]. \n \nWe genotyped the two single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1050450 and rs1001179) by the 5\u2032 nuclease assay (TaqMan\u00ae) in 384-well format, using the ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The distributions of genotypes for the two SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among controls (p=0.94, 0.83, respectively). We compared the cases of each type of skin cancer to the common control series. We used unconditional multivariate logistic regression to model the association between genetic polymorphisms and skin cancer risk and to estimate multivariate Odds Ratios (ORs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). To test statistical significance of gene-environmental interactions, we used dominant model for genotypes and dichotomized environmental exposures as low versus high based on median values among controls. We tested the statistical significance of a single multiplicative interaction term. \n \nIn the main effect analysis (Table 1), we observed that the GPX1 198 Leu/Leu genotype was significantly associated with a two-fold increased risk of melanoma (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.22\u20133.72), after adjustment for age and other covariates. No association was found between this polymorphism and SCC or BCC risk, which was consistent with one previous study [7]. This polymorphism has been shown to be associated with lung cancer [8] and breast cancer [3] previously. We did not observe significant association between the CAT C-262T polymorphism and the risk of any type of skin cancer. \n \n \n \nTable 1 \n \nAssociation between GPX Pro198Leu and CAT C-262T genetic polymorphisms and skin cancer risk a \n \n \n \nAs exploratory analyses, we further tested gene-environment interactions between the genetic variants and lifestyle factors that modulate oxidative stress. We found the association between the CAT C-262T polymorphism and melanoma risk was significantly modified by history of severe sunburns (p for interaction, 0.008, Table 2), a variable combining exposure intensity and biological response to sun exposure. The positive association between history of severe sunburns and melanoma risk was restricted to T carriers (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.02\u20132.92), compared to women with CC genotype (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.63\u20131.69). We also observed a significant gene-diet interaction between the CAT C-262T polymorphism and total carotenoid intake on melanoma risk (p for interaction, 0.01). The inverse association of total carotenoid intake with melanoma risk was limited among women with CC genotype (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41\u20130.97), whereas no association was observed among T carriers (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.77\u20131.97). Inconsistent results were reported on the relationship between dietary carotenoid intake and melanoma risk in several previous case-control studies. An inverse association between the intake and the risk of melanoma was observed in some studies [9], but not in other studies [10]. Our results suggest that the inconsistency in the literature may reflect a potential gene-diet interaction. As we tested different genetic polymorphisms, multiple environmental exposures and dietary factors, and three types of skin cancer, multiple testing in our study may lead to false positive results. Replications in independent studies are needed to validate these results. No significant interactions were observed between the GPX1 polymorphism and these lifestyle factors on melanoma risk.

Intake of antioxidants was estimated in 1996. Incident, histologically-confirmed BCC and SCC were recorded between 1996 and 2004. High dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin was associated with a reduced incidence of SCC in persons who had a history of skin cancer at baseline (highest versus lowest tertile, multivariable adjusted relative risk (RR)=0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.89; P for trend=0.02). In persons without a history of skin cancer at baseline, development of BCC was positively associated with intake of vitamins C and E from foods plus supplements (RR=3.1, 95% CI: 1.1-8.6; P for trend=0.03 and RR=2.6, 95% CI: 1.1-6.3; P for trend=0.02, respectively). In those with a skin cancer history at baseline, dietary intake in the second tertile for beta-carotene (multivariable adjusted RR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.2-4.1) and for vitamin E (multivariable adjusted RR=2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-3.9) was associated with increased BCC risk, with no trend, and similar results were seen in those with a specific history of BCC. These data suggest quite different associations between antioxidant intake and SCC compared with BCC, consistent with other evidence of their different causal pathways.\n\n==\n\nReiners 1991:\n\nTitle: Assessment of the antioxidant/prooxidant status of murine skin following topical treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and throughout the ontogeny of skin cancer. Part I: Quantitation of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and xanthine oxidase.\n\nAbstract: The activities of several enzymes involved in reactive oxygen production and detoxification were quantified in murine skin during the ontogeny of chemically induced skin cancer. Relative to solvent-treated controls, the specific activities of epidermal superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were reduced approximately 45, approximately 60 and approximately 24% respectively, 24 h after the fourth or tenth topical application of 1 microgram of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to the dorsal skin of SENCAR mice. The specific activity of epidermal xanthine oxidase (XO) increased approximately 350% during the same period. SOD and CAT specific activities in papillomas and carcinomas generated in an initiation-promotion protocol were approximately 15 and approximately 40% respectively of the activities measured in age-matched, non-treated mice. CAT and SOD activities were also significantly suppressed in the skin adjacent to the papillomas for several weeks following the cessation of TPA promotion, but eventually recovered to the levels measured in age-matched controls. XO specific activities in papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) were approximately 85-350% greater than the activities determined in skin adjacent to the tumors. The increases in XO and the decreases in SOD and CAT activities measured in the tumors were independent of continued treatment with TPA, and thus characteristic of the tumor phenotype. GPX activities in papillomas were comparable to normal, untreated skin, but reduced approximately 22-41% in SCC. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that TPA orchestrates changes in the activities of several enzymes involved in reactive oxygen metabolism that are characteristic of the papilloma and SCC phenotype.\n\n==\n\nFuchs 1989:\n\nTitle: Impairment of enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidants in skin by UVB irradiation.\n\nAbstract: Antioxidants may play a significant role in ameliorating or preventing photobiologic damage in skin that could lead to cutaneous disorders such as cancer and premature aging. The objective of this study was to assess the acute cutaneous enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidant response to a single exposure of large fluence (300 mJ/cm2) ultraviolet radiation (greater than 280 nm) in hairless mice. This treatment caused an immediate and statistically significant inhibition of glutathione reductase and catalase activity. Glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase were not affected. Glutathione levels decreased and, conversely glutathione disulfide concentrations increased. A slight depletion of the total glutathione was observed, while the content of total ascorbic acid did not change. The lipophilic antioxidants alpha-tocopherol, ubiquinol 9 and ubiquinone 9 also decreased significantly, and the concentration of malondialdehyde remained constant. The free radical scavenging activity of epidermis, as assessed by reduction of the stable, cationic nitroxide radical [2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinoxy-4-(2',4',6'-trimethyl) methylpyridinium perchlorate] was considerably inhibited. The study indicates that immediately after exposure to a large fluence of ultraviolet radiation the enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidant capacity of skin decreases significantly.\n\n==\n\nPrabasheela 2011:\n\nTitle: Association between Antioxidant Enzymes and Breast Cancer\n\nAbstract: The exact antioxidant status in breast cancer patient is still not clear.

When the data were analyzed with age matched control the antioxidant \u00c2\u00a0 levels were found to decrease indicating enhanced \u00c2\u00a0 free radical activity in breast cancer patients while the antioxidant defense mechanism is weakened.

However, a few cancer types have been found to have elevated levels of antioxidant enzymes, particularly manganese superoxide dismutase. Morphologic studies of animal and human cancer have confirmed that although the majority of tumor cell types from several organ systems have low antioxidant enzymes, adenocarcinomas may have elevated manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase levels. However, all cancers examined to date have some imbalance in antioxidant enzyme levels compared with the cell of origin. Antioxidant enzyme importance in cancer genesis has been difficult to evaluate in early cancerous lesions using biochemical techniques because such lesions are small and therefore below the level of detection. Using immunohistochemical techniques, early lesions of human and animal cancers were demonstrated to have low antioxidant enzymes, thus suggesting a role for these enzymes both in the genesis of cancer and the malignant phenotype.

UV radiation is the most important environmental factor in the development of skin cancer and skin aging. The primary products caused by UV exposure are generally direct DNA oxidation or generation of free radicals which form and decompose extremely quickly but can produce effects that can last for hours, days, or even years. UV-induced generation of ROS in the skin develops oxidative stress when their formation exceeds the antioxidant defense ability. The reduction of oxidative stress can be achieved on two levels: by lowering exposure to UVR and/or by increasing levels of antioxidant defense in order to scavenge ROS. The only endogenous protection of our skin is melanin and enzymatic antioxidants. Melanin, the pigment deposited by melanocytes, is the first line of defense against DNA damage at the surface of the skin, but it cannot totally prevent skin damage. A second category of defense is repair processes, which remove the damaged biomolecules before they can accumulate and before their presence results in altered cell metabolism. Additional UV protection includes avoidance of sun exposure, usage of sunscreens, protective clothes, and antioxidant supplements.", "final_summary": "The relationship between antioxidant enzymes and skin cancer risk is a complex one, as evidenced by the findings from several studies. \n\nHe (2010) found that the GPX1 198 Leu/Leu genotype was associated with a two-fold increased risk of melanoma, and the association between the CAT C-262T polymorphism and melanoma risk was significantly modified by history of severe sunburns and total carotenoid intake.

We demonstrate that by combining these data with information on protein-protein, prote in-DNA or metabolic networks, it is possible to uncover physical mechanisms behind many of the observed genetic effects. Using a probabilistic model, we found that 1,922 genetic interactions are significantly associated with either between- or within-pathway explanations encoded in the physical networks, covering \u223c40% of known genetic interactions. These models predict new functions for 343 proteins and suggest that between-pathway explanations are better than within-pathway explanations at interpreting genetic interactions identified in systematic screens.

Yeast genome-wide screens have taken advantage of libraries of deletion strains, but RNA-interference has been used in other organisms to knockdown gene function. Examples of recent large-scale functional genetic screens include drug-target identification in yeast, regulators of fat accumulation in worms, growth and viability in flies, and proteasome-mediated degradation in mammalian cells.

In this paper, we use general transit feed specification data to measure local-scale public transport availability across England based on service frequency and spatial proximity to public transport stops/stations. Moreover, to demonstrate the usefulness of public transport availability measures, we examine inequalities of public transport provision and identify areas at risk of transport poverty across England. Furthermore, we estimate population (number of households) who are likely to suffer from transport poverty, accounting for public transport availability, time-based job accessibility by public transport or walking, household income and car ownership levels. Based on the criteria, we have used to identify public transport risk, we find that investment in the development of public transport services should prioritise West Midlands, East of England, South East and South West as those regions have more households who are likely to suffer from transport poverty.

To address this goal, public transport plays a fundamental role and, therefore, it is key for developing a sustainable and equitable city. This paper proposes a methodology to analyze access to opportunities through public transport incorporating the user's valuation of attributes that impact the level of service on his/her trip and the competitiveness for urban opportunities. Using data from Santiago, Chile, we applied the proposed methodology to analyze accessibility to higher-quality public primary schools. We compare total travel time (TTT) with a proposed measure of total generalized travel time (TGTT) using simple potential and competitive accessibility indicators, accounting for the subjective valuation of walking time, travel time, waiting time, comfort and transfers, and translating them into in-vehicle time units. We find that the inclusion of competition has a more substantial impact than including the subjective valuation of the level of service in the accessibility to educational opportunities. Using competitive measures with TGTT, we found that around 20% of the zones in Santiago have at least a 50% deficit of higher-quality public education, and 71% of them are in peripheral areas. Furthermore, these zones, where medium and low-income population usually lives, can experience, on average, 1\u20132 transfers, 4\u20135 passengers per square meter, and 15-min waiting. We conclude that the proposed methodology provides a more comprehensive way to understand accessibility by incorporating the traveling experience, allowing to determine how and where to intervene to effectively improve accessibility, with a focus on urban equity.\n\n==\n\nPathak 2017:\n\nTitle: Public transit access and the changing spatial distribution of poverty\n\nAbstract: Abstract This article examines whether access to public transportation plays a significant role in determining the spatial distribution of poverty in a metropolitan area. Our empirical strategy relies on long-term changes in poverty and access to bus transit at the neighborhood level in the Atlanta metropolitan area. We estimate the effect of bus transit access on poverty using fixed effects models to control for time-invariant unobservable characteristics. Furthermore, we undertake several robustness checks using a combination of instrumental variable regression, subsample analysis, and propensity score matching. Our results indicate that, on average, after controlling for neighborhood characteristics, census tracts with better access to public bus transportation have a higher proportion of low-income households \u2013 in both the central city and the suburbs. Thus, policies that improve access to transit in underserved areas can plausibly expand residential opportunities for the poor and reduce spatial inequities in urban centers.\n\n==\n\nMart\u00ednez 2017:\n\nTitle: Creating inequality in accessibility: The relationships between public transport and social housing policy in deprived areas of Santiago de Chile\n\nAbstract: This paper identifies the very limited connectivity provided by the current public transport system to the most deprived groups of Santiago de Chile, and explores the territorial aspects of transport and social housing policies that have contributed to the creation of unequal public transport schemes. To achieve those aims, we present a review of public policies in Chile and the results of an original quantitative analysis that measures the travel times required to access the opportunities and activities located in the city. The results show that housing policies put people at a disadvantage by increasing the distance between them and the opportunities of the city. Three decades after the implementation of housing policies, transport still fails to mitigate these distances and instead of alleviating the patterns of segregation, it may have reinforced them. The travel times required increase towards the periphery (even though densities do not decrease) and are higher than the averages of the city in social housing estates.\n\n==\n\nKelobonye 2020:\n\nTitle: Measuring the accessibility and spatial equity of urban services under competition using the cumulative opportunities measure\n\nAbstract: Abstract As accessibility becomes an increasingly relevant concept in the analysis of sustainable transport and urban development, the accuracy of accessibility measures becomes increasingly vital. While more complex measures are gradually gaining popularity with increasing data and computational resources, policy makers and planners are still prone to opt for less complex methods that are easy to use and interpret. The cumulative opportunities measure is the most widely applied accessibility measure in planning practice, but it is also among the least accurate due to its lack of consideration of the impact of competition for those opportunities. This study seeks to highlight the impact of addressing competition for different urban services in the cumulative opportunities measure. A competition component is added to the measure, which is applied to a case study of three types of urban services in the Perth metropolitan area; jobs, primary/secondary education and shopping. The results show that considering competition changes the spatial patterns of accessibility and its equity. Since this approach reveals demand-supply imbalances, it can more accurately determine spatial inequalities in accessibility, and hence increases the utility of the cumulative opportunities measure. We also find that the three services had varying levels and spatial patterns of accessibility and spatial equity, thus relying on any single one of them for assessing spatial structural performance can be misleading.\n\n==\n\nScheurer 2017:\n\nTitle: Spatial accessibility of public transport in Australian cities: Does it relieve or entrench social and economic inequality?\n\nAbstract: City planning in Australian cities has seen a gradual shift in approach, away from planning to facilitate mobility by car in the post-war period toward planning for land-use/public transport integration. By assessing the supply of public transport for city accessibility, a considerable variation within each city can be seen. Of interest is the extent to which there is a relationship between the quality of public transport accessibility and the spatial distribution of socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage. This paper examines this issue by mapping spatial data on socioeconomic disadvantage and advantage against indicators of public transport accessibility. The findings show that Australian cities are characterized by a significant level of spatially manifested socioeconomic inequality exacerbated by transport disadvantage. It is argued that a coincidence of public transport infrastructure and service improvements as well as urban intensification and housing affordability policies are required to counteract these trends.\n\n==\n\nHern\u00e1ndez 2017:\n\nTitle: Uneven mobilities, uneven opportunities: Social distribution of public transport accessibility to jobs and education in Montevideo\n\nAbstract: Even though mobility is a requirement for participation in \u201cmodern life\u201d, the truth is that mobility is unevenly distributed and it constitutes a field of contestation and dispute among social classes. Mobility does not derive from individual decisions or free choices. On the contrary, it is the result of the interaction between individual attributes and social structure. To grasp this interaction, it is necessary to go well beyond observed mobility. This paper explores the unequal access to urban opportunities among different social classes in Montevideo. It does so by computing potential public transport accessibility to two types of crucial opportunities: jobs and education. The paper findings show an unequal distribution of potential mobility, especially for jobs and upper level public education. Primary public schools are an exception, revealing the spatial footprint of the mature Uruguayan social protection network at this level. This paper's approach allows to identify and describe various fields of contestation such as urban form, transit network, the state provision of public goods (in the case of education), through examining the effects of uneven mobility on social goods access and, as a result, on social equity.\n\n==\n\nMohammadi 2018:\n\nTitle: Optimising public transport for reducing employment barriers and fighting poverty\n\nAbstract: Alleviating poverty in low-income and developing nations is integral to social stability, attracting investments and generating employment opportunities which in turn elevate people\u2019s well-being. Employment could be encouraged through a combination of direct (travel time and training) and indirect measures (social institutions like childcare and elder care). Other factors such as legal reform and infrastructure services could help as well. Transit is perhaps the first element (but not the only one) required to provide better access to the labor market, to health and educational facilities and to social institutions. Transit should be cheap, fast, safe, and secure to reach to most travelers within the influence area. The main objective of this research is to propose a method to fight poverty through better access to employment by a proactive cost-effective planning of investments in existing and future public transit systems. A decision-making system is developed to assess the current employment situation in different geographical regions considering unemployment rate, access to jobs and public transportation systems. Real data from a case study of the Costa Rica metropolitan area is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed model can lead governments to a cost-effective solution that decreases the employment barrier index by more than 50% during the first 5 years. The proposed model will be beneficial for transit agencies in charge of BRT, Tramway, and suburban trains.", "final_summary": "The intricate interplay between public transport accessibility, competition, inequality, and poverty is a multifaceted issue.

Although in several papers it is mentioned that the combination of K SVMs can be used to solve a K-class classification problem, such a procedure requires some care. In this paper, the scaling problem of different SVMs is highlighted. Various normalization methods are proposed to cope with this problem and their efficiencies are measured empirically. This simple way of ssing SVMs to learn a K-class classification problem consists in choosing the maximum applied to the outputs of K SVMs solving a one-per-class decomposition of the general problem. In the second part of this paper, more sophisticated techniques are suggested. On the one hand, a stacking of the K SVMs with other classification techniques is proposed. On the other end, the one-per-class decomposition scheme is replaced by more elaborated schemes based on error-correcting codes. An incremental algorithm for the elaboration of pertinent decomposition schemes is mentioned, which exploits the properties of SVMs for an efficient computation.\n\n==\n\nYing 2001:\n\nTitle: The Mechanism of Classification for Support Vector Machines\n\nAbstract: The support vector machine is a novel type of learning technique, based on statistical learning theory, which uses Mercer kernels for efficiently performing computations in high dimensional spaces.

The formulation embodies the Structural Risk Minimisation (SRM) principle, which in our work has been shown to be superior to traditional Empirical Risk Minimisation (ERM) principle employed by conventional neural networks. SRM minimises an upper bound on the VC dimension (generalisation error), as opposed to ERM which minimises the error on the training data.

The power variations are mainly supplied by the supercapacitor and the lithium ion battery functions as a backup. In this regard, the proposed system saves $ 2205,724 by supplying energy to the tramway and selling the excess energy to the grid for 20 years.

Public transportation plays an important role in eco-friendly transportation and establishing a railway-oriented public transportation system is important. Among modes of railway traffic, trams are easy to access compared with subways (a representative modes of railway transportation) and are economical because of their low construction and operation costs. If a priority signal is given to the tram operation, the scheduled speed increases; The efficiency can be further improved. The purpose of this study was to analyse how the conversion of modes to public transportation caused by tram construction can affect the atmosphere and to study how much the increase in physical activity caused by the increase in public transportation affects the reduction of disease. Dongtan New Town in Korea, where trams are scheduled to be introduced, was set as the study area, and the effect of the conversion of modes of transportation resulting from tram construction was analysed through the modal split process of the four-stage transportation demand prediction model. The analysis shows that trams will generate a 54,700 trips/d conversion to public transportation within the affected area.

One of the important implications of this reform is that current fuel taxes are decreased to a level of 80 euro/ton of CO2 but that the mileage related taxes on car and truck use increase. Using the TREMOVE model for the transport sector of 31 European countries, one finds that the volume of transport will decrease because current taxes on transport are too low compared to overall external costs. Overall CO2 emissions will decrease slightly. Using the MARKAL-TIMES model for the Belgian energy sector, putting all sectors and technologies on equal footing shows that a fuel tax reform makes that it is not cost efficient to require large CO2 emission reductions in the transport sector and that traditional car technologies will continue to dominate the car market in 2020-2030.\n\n==\n\nZilka 2021:\n\nTitle: Sustainability evaluation of the use of cargo-trams for mixed municipal waste transport in Prague.\n\nAbstract: The use of trams for the transport of waste from urban areas to waste incineration facilities - does it make sense, would it be technically feasible, economically sustainable and environmentally beneficial? These are the questions which we attempted to answer in this comprehensive study. The analysis is performed for a specific potential implementation of this system in Prague and adjacent municipalities. In this work, we compare the current state, where mixed municipal waste is transported to an incineration plant directly by garbage trucks, with variants if mixed municipal waste were taken to transfer stations and from there transported over a longer distance in a large volume by means of tram or truck. Our results show that use of trams results in an overall cost level of \u20ac16.41 per ton of waste transported, which represents a slight saving against the existing system at a cost of \u20ac17.19 per ton. From the purely economic perspective, however, this does not compete with transportation by truck at \u20ac12.28 per ton - above all due to high initial investment into new cargo trams. From the environmental viewpoint, deploying trams brings benefits largely on the local level, where emissions would be reduced by about 50% against the current state. In the global view, assessed through the Life Cycle Assessment method, it appears however only to transfer emissions to the point of energy production, and from this perspective the use of trams is beneficial only if linked with a notable shift from fossil fuel energy to nuclear or renewable sources.\n\n==\n\nKoetse 2009:\n\nTitle: The impact of climate change and weather on transport: An overview of empirical findings\n\nAbstract: This paper presents a survey of the empirical literature on the effects of climate change and weather conditions on the transport sector. Despite mixed evidence on many issues, several patterns can be observed. On a global scale especially shifts in tourism and agricultural production due to increased temperatures may lead to shifts in passenger and freight transport. The predicted rise in sea levels and the associated increase in frequency and intensity of storm surges and flooding incidences may furthermore be some of the most worrying consequences of climate change, especially for coastal areas. Climate change related shifts in weather patterns might also cause infrastructure disruptions. Clear patterns are that precipitation affects road safety by increasing accident frequency but decreasing severity. Precipitation also increases congestion, especially during peak hours. Furthermore, an increased frequency of low water levels may considerably increase costs of inland waterway transport. Despite these insights, the net impact of climate change on generalised costs of the various transport modes are uncertain and ambiguous, with a possible exception for inland waterway transport.\n\n==\n\nNanaki 2017:\n\nTitle: Environmental assessment of 9 European public bus transportation systems\n\nAbstract: The transportation sector is one of the largest sources of EU\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. In 2011, transportation represented approximately 25 percent of total EU\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Urban mobility accounts for 40% of all CO2 emissions of road transport and up to 70% of other pollutants from transport. As, transportation and mobility play a crucial part both in urban economics and the quality of life, it is of great significance to ensure a low carbon transportation sector, so as to deal with the threat that climate change poses to urban areas. This study examines the factors that affect the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as of air pollutants, in 9 major European cities, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the actual knowledge on the atmospheric pollution from public transportation systems. CO2 emissions as well as air pollutants, such as CO, HC, PM, NOx are calculated for the diesel and CNG bus fleets of the European cities under study. Finally the environmental benefits, in terms of CO2 and CO, HC, PM, NOx emissions reductions, from the penetration of different biodiesel blends (from B10 to B100) to the bus fleets are estimated.\n\n==\n\nBorken-Kleefeld 2010:\n\nTitle: Specific climate impact of passenger and freight transport.\n\nAbstract: Emissions of short-lived species contribute significantly to the climate impact of transportation.

Second, the impacts are normalized with the transport work performed and modes are compared. Calculations are performed for the integrated radiative forcing and mean temperature change, for different time horizons and various measures of transport work. An unambiguous ranking of the specific climate impact can be established for freight transportation, with shipping and rail having lowest and light trucks and air transport having highest specific impact for all cases calculated. Passenger travel with rail, coach or two- and three-wheelers has on average the lowest specific climate impact also on short time horizons. Air travel has the highest specific impact on short-term warming, while on long-term warming car travel has an equal or higher impact per passenger-kilometer.", "final_summary": "The collective body of research presents a nuanced picture of the environmental impacts of transport fare prices and climate change. \n\nCano (2021) highlights the potential of sustainable tramways, which combine renewable energy sources and energy-saving technologies, to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save costs.

High inflammatory burden associated with RA appears to be a key driver of the increased cardiovascular risk. Inflammation is linked with accelerated atherosclerosis and associated with a paradoxical inversion of the relationship between CV risk and lipid levels in patients with untreated RA, recently coined the lipid paradox. Furthermore, the inflammatory burden is also associated with qualitative as well as quantitative changes in lipoproteins, with the anti-inflammatory and atheroprotective roles associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly altered. RA therapies can increase lipid levels, which may reflect the normalization of lipids due to their inflammatory-dampening effects. However, these confounding influences of inflammation and RA therapies on lipid profiles pose challenges for assessing CV risk in RA patients and interpretation of traditional CV risk scores. In this review we examine the relationship between the increased inflammatory burden in RA and CV risk, exploring how inflammation influences lipid profiles, the impact of RA therapies and strategies for identifying and monitoring CV risk in RA patients aimed at improving CV outcomes.\n\n==\n\nW\u00e5llberg-Jonsson 1999:\n\nTitle: Extent of inflammation predicts cardiovascular disease and overall mortality in seropositive rheumatoid arthritis.

Potential predictors for CVD, as measured by \"the first cardiovascular event,\" and for overall survival were registered. The predictors were identified by extended Cox regression models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn simple Cox regression analysis, male sex, higher age at disease onset, HLA-B27, high disease activity, corticosteroid treatment early in disease, and hypertension significantly increased risk of cardiovascular event. Higher educational level, extensive disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment, and corticosteroids > or =1 yr before event decreased the risk. In multiple Cox regression analysis, male sex, high age at disease onset, hypertension, higher haptoglobin level at disease onset, and corticosteroid treatment early in disease increased risk of CVD. In a multiple model comprising only patients with CVD, corticosteroids delayed the event. A high last registered erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) value before event increased CVD risk, in particular when early in disease progression. Decreased life span was predicted by higher age at disease onset, male sex, low education level, high disease activity, hypertension, and CVD. HLA-B27 was associated with decreased life span, as was early, but not extensive corticosteroid treatment. DMARD treatment was associated with decreased mortality risk, as was the presence of joint prosthesis. In multiple regression, male sex, higher age at disease onset, atlantoaxial subluxation early in disease, hypertension, and cardiovascular event increased mortality. A high last registered ESR value before event or death added to that risk.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe study emphasizes the importance of inflammation as an important risk indicator for CVD and mortality in RA.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who by definition manifest persistent high levels of inflammation, are at greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Mechanisms mediating this enhanced risk are ill defined. On the basis of available evidence, we argue here that the systemic inflammatory response in RA is critical to accelerated atherogenesis operating via accentuation of established and novel risk factor pathways. By implication, long-term suppression of the systemic inflammatory response in RA should be effective in reducing risk of coronary heart disease. Early epidemiological observational and clinical studies are commensurate with this hypothesis. By contrast, risk factor modulation with conventional agents, such as statins, may provide unpredictable clinical benefit in the context of uncontrolled systemic inflammatory parameters. Unraveling such complex relationships in which exaggerated inflammation-risk factor interactions are prevalent may elicit novel insights to effector mechanisms in vascular disease generally.\n\n==\n\nStevens 2005:\n\nTitle: Inflammation and atherosclerosis in rheumatoid arthritis\n\nAbstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) associates with increased cardiovascular mortality. This appears to be predominantly due to ischaemic causes, such as myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. The higher prevalence of cardiac ischaemia in RA is thought to be due to the accelerated development of atherosclerosis. There are two main reasons for this, which might be inter-related: the systemic inflammatory load, characteristic of RA; and the accumulation in RA of classical risk factors for coronary heart disease, which is reminiscent of the metabolic syndrome. We describe and discuss in the context of RA the involvement of local and systemic inflammatory processes in the development and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques, as well as the role of individual risk factors for coronary heart disease. We also present the challenges facing the clinical and scientific communities addressing this problem, which is receiving increasing attention.\n\n==\n\nKitas 2010:\n\nTitle: Cardiovascular disease in rheumatoid arthritis: state of the art and future perspectives\n\nAbstract: Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Epidemiological evidence suggests that classic cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and body composition alterations are important but not sufficient to explain all of the excess risk. High-grade systemic inflammation and its interplay with classic risk factors may also contribute. Some associations between classic risk factors and cardiovascular risk in people with rheumatoid arthritis appear counterintuitive but may be explained on the basis of biological alterations. More research is necessary to uncover the exact mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon, develop accurate systems used to identify patients at high risk, design and assess prevention strategies specific to this population of patients.\n\n==\n\nMyasoedova 2011:\n\nTitle: Lipid paradox in rheumatoid arthritis: the impact of serum lipid measures and systemic inflammation on the risk of cardiovascular disease\n\nAbstract: Objective To examine the impact of systemic inflammation and serum lipids on cardiovascular disease (CVD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods In a population-based RA incident cohort (1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria first met between 1988 and 2007), details were collected of serum lipid measures, erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs), C-reactive protein (CRP) measures and cardiovascular events, including ischaemic heart disease and heart failure. Cox models were used to examine the association of lipids and inflammation with the risk of CVD and mortality, adjusting for age, sex and year of RA incidence. Results The study included 651 patients with RA (mean age 55.8 years, 69% female); 67% were rheumatoid factor positive. ESR was associated with the risk of CVD (HR=1.2 per 10 mm/h increase, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3). Similar findings, although not statistically significant, were seen with CRP (p=0.07). A significant non-linear association for total cholesterol (TCh) with risk of CVD was found, with 3.3-fold increased risk for TCh <4 mmol/l (95% CI 1.5 to 7.2) and no increased risk of CVD for TCh \u22654 mmol/l (p=0.57). Low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL <2 mmol/l) was associated with marginally increased risk of CVD (p=0.10); there was no increased risk for LDL \u22652 mmol/l (p=0.76). Conclusion Inflammatory measures (particularly, ESR) are significantly associated with the risk of CVD in RA. Lipids may have paradoxical associations with the risk of CVD in RA, whereby lower TCh and LDL levels are associated with increased cardiovascular risk.\n\n==\n\nGarc\u00eda-G\u00f3mez 2014:\n\nTitle: Inflammation, lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis: A qualitative relationship?\n\nAbstract: Life expectancy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is reduced compared to the general population owing to an increase in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) not fully explained by traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In recent years, interest has been focused on the alterations in lipid metabolism in relation to chronic inflammation as one of the possible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis of RA patients. Research regarding this issue has revealed quantitative alterations in lipoproteins during the acute-phase reaction, and has also demonstrated structural alterations in these lipoproteins which affect their functional abilities. Although many alterations in lipid metabolism have been described in this regard, these structural changes associated with inflammation are particularly important in high-density lipoproteins as they affect their cardioprotective functions. In this respect, excessive oxidation in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and increased lipoprotein(a) with a predominance of smaller apolipoprotein(a) isoforms has also been reported. This article will discuss proinflammatory high-density lipoproteins (piHDL), oxidized LDL and lipoprotein(a). Elevated concentrations of these lipoproteins with marked pro-atherogenic properties have been observed in RA patients, which could help to explain the increased cardiovascular risk of these patients.", "final_summary": "Inflammation, a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), has been identified as a key player in increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in RA patients. Troelsen (2006) and Choy (2014) both highlight the role of chronic inflammation in accelerating atherosclerosis, a major contributor to CVD. This inflammatory burden not only speeds up the atherosclerosis process but also influences lipid profiles, leading to a paradoxical relationship between cardiovascular risk and lipid levels in untreated RA patients, a phenomenon termed the \"lipid paradox\" (Choy, 2014; Myasoedova, 2011).\n\nThe extent of inflammation has been directly linked to CVD and overall mortality in RA patients (W\u00e5llberg-Jonsson, 1999). Sattar (2003) and Stevens (2005) further elaborate on this, suggesting that high-grade systemic inflammation in RA interacts with conventional and novel vascular risk factors to promote atherogenesis. This implies that suppressing the systemic inflammatory response could potentially reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in RA patients (Sattar, 2003).\n\nHowever, the relationship between inflammation and CVD in RA is complex. Kitas (2010) and Garc\u00eda-G\u00f3mez (2014) note that while traditional cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension and dyslipidemia are important, they are not sufficient to explain the increased cardiovascular risk in RA. The interplay between high-grade systemic inflammation and these risk factors may contribute to the increased risk. Furthermore, Garc\u00eda-G\u00f3mez (2014) points out that inflammation-related alterations in lipid metabolism and lipoprotein structure could affect their functional abilities, further increasing cardiovascular risk.\n\nIn conclusion, the papers collectively suggest that inflammation, a characteristic feature of RA, plays a pivotal role in increasing the risk of CVD in RA patients. This is achieved through accelerating atherosclerosis, influencing lipid profiles, and interacting with traditional cardiovascular risk factors. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this relationship are complex and require further research."}, {"query": "In project management research, time horizon is to the duration of a study's data collection period or the length of time over which data is analyzed (Wong et al., 2021).

The launch of a mediating institute may also be part of the solution.\n\n==\n\nLee 1999:\n\nTitle: Time in Organizational Studies: Towards a New Research Direction\n\nAbstract: While there is much `time-related research', there is little `research on time'. This is striking since time is a key point in understanding organizations, their actions, culture, efficacy, etc. Most studies of time in management and organizational theory take time for granted. While there are numerous studies that address temporal issues, they are widely dispersed and unsystematic. This paper provides a classification of temporal studies of organizations and management. The scheme is built around two criteria: concepts of time and the role of time in research design. In the former, there are two contrasting concepts of time: clock time and social time. In the latter, time plays the roles of independent or dependent variables. By intersecting the two criteria, four notions of temporality (`deciding', `working', `varying' and `changing' times) are introduced to account for a variety of studies of time. The resulting classification not only reveals the current situation of studies about time, but it also indicates a direction which further research effort should take. We conclude by showing that temporally sensitive approaches will benefit research on organizations.\n\n==\n\nReilly 2016:\n\nTitle: Time Horizon of Investments in the Resource Allocation Process\n\nAbstract: Corporate investment inherently relies on time horizon, as profits result from acquiring assets or developing capabilities that yield future benefits that exceed upfront costs. Despite the importance of time horizon to understanding resource allocation, knowledge about the subject has accumulated slowly. Our review therefore encompasses insights from several research streams that partially address the subject even though time horizon is not the central construct in any of them. We aim to clarify key constructs related to time horizon, organize prior research about the antecedents of time horizon, explain the implications of several theoretical traditions for time horizon, and detail the range of measures that have been used to capture time horizon empirically. By focusing narrowly on this topic but searching broadly for references, we provide integrative summaries of existing research and identify opportunities for new and unique research.\n\n==\n\nStritch 2017:\n\nTitle: Minding the Time: A Critical Look at Longitudinal Design and Data Analysis in Quantitative Public Management Research\n\nAbstract: Public management scholars are looking to longitudinal research designs and data to help overcome the many limitations associated with cross-sectional research. However, far less attention has been given to time itself as a research lens for scholars to consider. This article seeks to integrate time as a construct of theoretical importance into a discussion of longitudinal design, data, and public management research. First, I discuss the relative advantages of longitudinal design and data, but also the challenges, limitations, and issues researchers need to consider. Second, I consider the importance of time as a theoretical construct of interest in the pursuit of longitudinal public management research. Third, I offer a brief look at the use of longitudinal design and panel data analyses in the current public management literature. The overview demonstrates a notable absence of public management research considering the attitudes, motives, perceptions, and experiences of individual public employees and managers. Finally, I consider why there are so few longitudinal studies of public employees and point out the issues public management researchers interested in individual employee-level phenomena need to consider when advancing their own longitudinal research designs.", "final_summary": "The concept of time horizon in project management research is a multifaceted and complex topic that has been explored by numerous scholars. It pertains to the duration of a study's data collection period or the length of time over which data is analyzed (Ancona, 2001; Sonnentag, 2012; Basu, 2019; Bergh, 1993; Runeson, 2014; Lee, 1999; Reilly, 2016; Stritch, 2017).\n\nAncona (2001) and Sonnentag (2012) both emphasize the importance of time as a research lens in organizational studies, suggesting that it can provide valuable insights into various organizational phenomena. Basu (2019) further elaborates on the need for careful consideration when choosing a time horizon, as it must be long enough to capture all intended and unintended benefits and harms of the intervention(s) being studied.\n\nBergh (1993) warns of the potential misuse of time effects in research designs, data analyses, and interpretations, highlighting the need for careful operationalization of time effects. Runeson (2014) discusses the challenges posed by different time horizons in industry-academia collaboration projects, suggesting that mutual awareness and management commitment can help overcome these hurdles.\n\nLee (1999) provides a classification of temporal studies of organizations and management, emphasizing the need for temporally sensitive approaches in organizational research. Reilly (2016) discusses the importance of time horizon in understanding resource allocation, suggesting that it can provide valuable insights into corporate investment strategies.\n\nFinally, Stritch (2017) integrates time as a construct of theoretical importance into a discussion of longitudinal design and data in public management research. However, the specific focus of the paper is not solely on the advantages and challenges of longitudinal research designs, but also on the importance of time as a theoretical construct in the pursuit of longitudinal public management research.\n\nIn conclusion, the time horizon is a critical aspect of project management research that can provide valuable insights into various organizational phenomena. However, it must be carefully considered and appropriately operationalized to avoid potential misuse and to ensure the validity and reliability of the research findings (Ancona, 2001; Sonnentag, 2012; Basu, 2019; Bergh, 1993; Runeson, 2014; Lee, 1999; Reilly, 2016; Stritch, 2017)."}, {"query": "What is the codex alimentarius recommendation for second-age infant flour?", "paper_list_string": "Koletzko 2012:\n\nTitle: Compositional Requirements of Follow-Up Formula for Use in Infancy: Recommendations of an International Expert Group Coordinated by the Early Nutrition Academy\n\nAbstract: The follow-up formula (FUF) standard of Codex Alimentarius adopted in 1987 does not correspond to the recently updated Codex infant formula (IF) standard and current scientific knowledge. New Zealand proposed a revision of the FUF Codex standard and asked the non-profit Early Nutrition Academy, in collaboration with the Federation of International Societies for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (FISPGHAN), for a consultation with paediatric nutrition experts to provide scientific guidance. This global expert group strongly supports breastfeeding. FUF are considered dispensable because IF can substitute for breastfeeding throughout infancy, but FUF are widely used and thus the outdated current FUF standard should be revised. Like IF, FUF serve as breast milk substitutes; hence their marketing should respect appropriate standards. The compositional requirements for FUF for infants from 6 months onwards presented here were unanimously agreed upon. For some nutrients, the compositional requirements for FUF differ from those of IF due to differing needs with infant maturation as well as a rising contribution of an increasingly diversified diet with advancing age. FUF should be fed with adequate complementary feeding that is also appropriate for partially breastfed infants. FUF could be fed also after the age of 1 year without safety concerns, but different compositional requirements should be applied for optimal, age-adapted milk-based formulations for young children used only after the age of 1 year. This has not been considered as part of this review and should be the subject of further consideration.\n\n==\n\nKoletzko 2010:\n\nTitle: Global standard for the composition of infant formula: recommendations of an ESPGHAN coordinated international expert group.\n\nAbstract: The Codex Alimentarius Commission of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) develops food standards, guidelines and related texts for protecting consumer health and ensuring fair trade practices globally. The major part of the world's population lives in more than 160 countries that are members of the Codex Alimentarius. The Codex Standard on Infant Formula was adopted in 1981 based on scientific knowledge available in the 1970s and is currently being revised. As part of this process, the Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses asked the ESPGHAN Committee on Nutrition to initiate a consultation process with the international scientific community to provide a proposal on nutrient levels in infant formulae, based on scientific analysis and taking into account existing scientific reports on the subject. ESPGHAN accepted the request and, in collaboration with its sister societies in the Federation of International Societies on Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, invited highly qualified experts in the area of infant nutrition to form an International Expert Group (IEG) to review the issues raised. The group arrived at recommendations on the compositional requirements for a global infant formula standard which are reported here.\n\n==\n\nZlotkin 2010:\n\nTitle: The Role of the Codex Alimentarius Process in Support of New Products to Enhance the Nutritional Health of Infants and Young Children\n\nAbstract: The Codex Alimentarius is a collection of internationally recognized standards, codes of practice, guidelines, and other recommendations relating to foods, food production, and food safety. Among other functions, it is responsible for setting international standards for safety and hygiene. Codex food standards and guidelines directed at foods produced primarily for young infants and children have important implications for maintaining nutritional status and health, especially given the positioning of these products as components of established World Health Organization (WHO)/UNICEF-recommended feeding strategies. Recently, new products targeted at this age group (e.g., lipid-based nutrient supplements and micronutrient powders) have been produced and used, but these are not totally covered under existing Codex guidelines or standards. The objective of this paper is to review the role of the Codex process and specifically to suggest revisions to existing Codex guidelines on formulated complementary foods (Guidelines for Formulated Supplementary Foods for Older Infants and Young Children, CAC/GL 08\u20131991) to encompass this new category of fortified complementary foods and home fortificants. In reviewing the existing guidelines, potential areas for revision included the sections on the recommended nutrients in these foods and their intended use. Updating the Codex guidelines provides the opportunity to encourage production and use of new products for children and help ensure that such foods, when used as directed, do not interfere with breastfeeding. The revised guidelines would help governments develop national regulations covering all forms of formulated complementary foods. They would also lessen impediments to international trade by providing clear guidance for foods used in feeding programs and for young children, particularly in developing countries.\n\n==\n\nDossa 2011:\n\nTitle: Evaluation of the suitability and acceptability of a newly designed infant flour for infant feeding in the district of Bopa in south of Benin\n\nAbstract: Infant feeding practices do not always fit with quantity and quality requirements,\u00a0leading to low expression of growth potential. In Benin, 43.1% of children less than6\u00a0months old are exclusively breastfed with 68% of children aged 6-8 months receiving\u00a0complementary food. The study aimed to produce infant flour from raw food\u00a0ingredients available in Bopa district and to test its acceptability by 6-12 months old children. In a first step of the study, formulation and determination of nutritional\u00a0characteristics of the infant flour occurred. A second step concerned acceptability\u00a0tests of gruel made from formulated infant flour. The study sample was composed of\u00a0sixty five mothers and their children. Children\ufffds acceptability test took place in the\u00a0morning for three consecutive days. The gruel was consumed ad libitum. Mothers\ufffd acceptability test consisted of appreciation of organoleptic characteristics of the gruel\u00a0and the infant flour processing.The infant flour was made of maize (65 %), bean (20\u00a0%) and peanut (15 %) and was manually processed. Chemical analysesshowed that it\u00a0contains 4.3% of moisture, 69.3% of carbohydrates, 15.1% of proteins, 10.7% of\u00a0lipids, less than 5% of crude fibres and 1.9% of ash. Its energy density (433.9 kcal/100g) was significantly greater than Codex Alimentarius standards (p<0.05).The\u00a0infant flour contained microbial germs up to 4.8log CFU/g which was closed to\u00a0maximum standard values. Total coliforms (1.7log CFU/g) were significantly lower\u00a0than standard values. The flour was yeast, mould and pathogen (Escherichia coli)\u00a0free. Hundred grams gruel was made from 40g of infant flour, 6g of malted maize and\u00a0250ml of stock of boiled greens leaves (Solanummacrocarpum). Dry matter content of\u00a0gruel was 19.2% and its energy density was 81.5 kcal/100g. Basedon the ratio of\u00a0intake and amount served, 83.3% of children accepted the gruel. However based on\u00a0the ratio of the amount of porridge consumed during the testto the amount usually\u00a0consumed by the children, 65.2% of the childrenaccepted the gruel. Mothers\ufffd appreciation of the gruel ranged from unpleasant to very pleasant with 40% as\u00a0pleasant. Sixty percent of mothers judged the infant flour processing as easy and\u00a0feasible. All mothers expressed their desire to feed their children with the gruel.\u00a0Improving nutritional status of their children motivated their decision. It is concluded\u00a0that integrating this infant flour in nutrition and counselling package targeted to\u00a0mothers may be of a great benefit to the children.\n\n==\n\nMacLean 2010:\n\nTitle: Upper levels of nutrients in infant formulas: Comparison of analytical data with the revised Codex infant formula standard\n\nAbstract: Abstract The Codex Alimentarius Commission adopted a revised standard for infant formula in 2007. This standard provides a regulatory framework for infant formula, including provisions for its essential composition. The recommendations for the essential composition specify minimum levels and either maximum values (MVs) or guidance upper levels (GULs) for 31 nutrients. As part of the revision process, the first cooperative survey of levels of nutrients in infant formulas was conducted by several global manufacturers. Whereas formulas met proposed minimum levels of all nutrients, 15 nutrients were identified whose levels were likely to exceed the proposed MV or GUL: vitamins A and K, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B 6 , folic acid, vitamin B 12 , vitamin C, iron, copper, manganese, potassium and iodine. Analytical data were collected for those nutrients from 21,385 batches of milk-based infant formula and 9070 batches of soy-based infant formula, whose total volumes were sufficient to feed more than 33 million infants for periods of three months. The number of batches analyzed ranged from 440 (vitamin K) to 27,920 (vitamin C). Of nutrients with an MV, only levels of vitamin A in some batches exceeded the maximum; no batch contained levels previously reported in the literature to be associated with adverse effects. There were several nutrients with GULs for which there were batches that exceeded the suggested upper limit. Data for some nutrients showed considerable variability, which related to form (liquid vs. powder), inherent levels of nutrients in formula ingredients, protein source, nutrient stability, analytical variability and effects of process, package and container size.\n\n==\n\nFao 2003:\n\nTitle: Codex alimentarius: food hygiene basic texts.\n\nAbstract: This publication contains guidance on the development and application of international food hygiene standards, which covers practices from primary production through to final consumption, highlighting key hygiene controls at each stage.

These foods are not adequately enriched and hygienic conditions are sometimes poor. Aims: The aim was to describe household production methods of infant flours and to estimate their macronutrient content in Benin. Methods: From August to October 2020, 20 mothers of children aged 6 to 11 months were selected in the municipalities of Cov\u00e8 and Djakotomey to examine the process of domestic production of infant flours and porridges. Data were collected using a touch screen questionnaire and the energy content of the flours produced by the mothers was calculated and evaluated using the FAO/INFOODS food composition table for West Africa. Results: The main process units for the production of the infant flours were milling:100%, sorting: cereals 60% and legumes: 33%, roasting: cereals 70%, and legumes: 91.7%. Mothers had poor hygienic practices regarding Material: 20%, Manipulator: 20%, and Milieu: 35% during the preparation of infant porridges. Four of the 20 formulas produced had an acceptable energy content, two had a standard fat content (10 - 25 g/100 g flour) and 12 had a standard protein content (15 g/100 g flour). Conclusions: This study showed that the main production methods of infant flours need to be improved. More, the overall energy content from these flours was lower than the recommended macronutrients contents by the standard FAO/WHO/UNICEF and the standards references. It is therefore important to maintain and strengthen nutritional interventions in order to improve the nutritional quality of homemade infant flours.\nKeywords: Infant flour, household production, nutrition, hygiene.\n\n==\n\nMikiel-Kostyra 2000:\n\nTitle: [Foodstuffs intended for special dietary uses for infants and young children in the light of the directives of the European Union and standards of the Codex Alimentarius FAO/WHO].\n\nAbstract: Food products for infants and young children are included in the group of foodstuffs intended for special dietary uses. The classification of these products comprises the following groups: newborns infant formulas, infant formulas, processed cereal foods and other baby foods for infants and young children and gluten-free products. In the European Union countries the detailed requirements concerning their qualitative and quantitative composition, labeling, advertising and release on the market as well as the health quality of these products have been laid down in the Council Directive of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses (89/398/EEC with later amendments) and in the detailed directives. Presently, work is being continued on preparing standards of the Codex Alimentarius FAO/WHO for infant formulas for processed cereal foods for infants and young children and for gluten-free foods. In the successive sessions of the Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses drafts of these standards are discussed. In the last session of the Committee in Berlin (19-23.06.2000) it was not possible to reach an agreement of views of the various delegations on the standards or their formulation. The work on them and trials at establishing international recommendations has been deferred to the next meeting.", "final_summary": "The Codex Alimentarius recommendations for second-age infant flour, also known as follow-up formula (FUF), are a topic of interest in the field of infant nutrition.

Differential patterns of protein expression were determined after 4 weeks of endurance or resistance exercise training. Following endurance exercise training, carbonic anhydrase III immunoglobulin heavy chain, myosin heavy chain 1, titin, chromosome 12, and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 2 were up-regulated while pyruvate kinase 3 isoform, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase, and phosphoglucomutase were down-regulated. After the 4 weeks of resistance exercise training, five proteins, apolipoprotein A-IV precursor, microtubule-actin cross linking factor 1, myosin light chain, growth hormone inducible transmembrane protein, and an unknown protein were up-regulated and pyruvate kinase 3 isoform, human albumin, and enolase 3 were down-regulated. We conclude that endurance and resistance exercise training differently alter the expression of individual muscle proteins, and that the response of muscle protein expression may be associated with specific myofibre adaptations to exercise training.

Repetitive muscle contraction through exercise stimuli leads to improved cardiovascular output and the regulation of endothelial dysfunction and metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and obesity. Considerable improvements in proteomic tools and data analysis have broth some new perspectives in the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle adaptation in response to physical activity. In this sense, this review updates the main relevant studies concerning muscle proteome adaptation to acute and chronic exercise, from aerobic to resistance training, as well as the proteomic profile of natural inbred high running capacity animal models. Also, some promising prospects in the muscle secretome field are presented, in order to better understand the role of physical activity in the release of extracellular microvesicles and myokines activity. Thus, the present review aims to update the fast\u2010growing exercise\u2010proteomic scenario, leading to some new perspectives about the molecular events under skeletal muscle plasticity in response to physical activity.

Despite the well\u2010established phenotypic alterations, the molecular mechanisms underlying exercise\u2010induced skeletal muscle remodeling are poorly characterized. Proteomics based on mass spectrometry have been successfully applied for the characterization of skeletal muscle proteome, representing a pivotal approach for the wide characterization of the molecular networks that lead to skeletal muscle remodeling. Nevertheless, few studies were performed to characterize the exercise\u2010induced proteome remodeling of skeletal muscle, with only six research papers focused on the cross\u2010talk between exercise and pathophysiological conditions. In order to add new insights on the impact of distinct exercise programs on skeletal muscle proteome, molecular network analysis was performed with bioinformatics tools. This analysis highlighted an exercise\u2010related proteome signature characterized by the up\u2010regulation of the capacity for ATP generation, oxygen delivery, antioxidant capacity and regulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Chronic endurance training up\u2010regulates the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation system, whereas the release of calcium ion into cytosol and amino acid metabolism are the biological processes up\u2010regulated by a single bout of exercise. Other issues as exercise intensity, load, mode and regimen as well as muscle type also influence the exercise\u2010induced proteome signature. The comprehensive analysis of the molecular networks modulated by exercise training in health and disease, taking in consideration all these variables, might not only support the therapeutic effect of exercise but also highlight novel targets for the development of enhanced pharmacological strategies.\n\n==\n\nBuford 2009:\n\nTitle: Resistance exercise-induced changes of inflammatory gene expression within human skeletal muscle\n\nAbstract: Aberrant local inflammatory signaling within skeletal muscle is now considered a contributing factor to the development of sarcopenia. Recent evidence indicates that chronic resistance training contributes to the control of locally derived inflammation via adaptations to repeated, acute increases in pro-inflammatory mRNA within muscle. However, only a limited number of gene transcripts related to the inflammatory process have been examined in the literature. The present study utilized an acute bout to examine the effects of resistance exercise on several inflammatory-related genes in 24 physically active, post-menopausal women not currently undergoing hormone replacement therapy. Following a standard warm-up, participants completed a lower-body resistance exercise bout consisting of 3 sets of 10 repetitions on machine squat, leg press, and leg extension exercises (80% intensity). Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis of the dominant leg at baseline and 3\u00a0h following exercise. Significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) up-regulation in mRNA content was observed for TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL6, IL8, SOCS2, COX2, SAA1, SAA2, IKKB, cfos, and junB. Muscle mRNA content was not significantly altered at the 0.05 level for IL2, IL5, IL10, or IL12 (p35). Venous blood samples were also obtained at baseline as well as at 3, 24, and 48\u00a0h post-exercise. Serum was analyzed for circulating TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL6, IL8, COX2, and SAA with no significant changes observed. These results indicate that resistance exercise is capable of up-regulating transcription of numerous inflammatory mediators within skeletal muscle, and these appear to be worthy of future examination in chronic studies.\n\n==\n\nYuan 2013:\n\nTitle: Proteomic Analysis of Skeletal Muscle in Insulin-Resistant Mice: Response to 6-Week Aerobic Exercise\n\nAbstract: Aerobic exercise has beneficial effects on both weight control and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity through a number of specific signaling proteins. To investigate the targets by which exercise exerts its effects on insulin resistance, an approach of proteomic screen was applied to detect the potential different protein expressions from skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant mice after prolonged aerobic exercise training and their sedentary controls. Eighteen C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups: 6 mice were fed normal chow (NC) and 12 mice were fed high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks to produce an IR model. The model group was then subdivided into HFD sedentary control (HC, n\u200a=\u200a6) and HFD exercise groups (HE, n\u200a=\u200a6). Mice in HE group underwent 6 weeks of treadmill running. After 6 weeks, mice were sacrificed and skeletal muscle was dissected. Total protein (n\u200a=\u200a6, each group) was extracted and followed by citrate synthase, 2D proteome profile analysis and immunoblot. Fifteen protein spots were altered between the NC and HC groups and 23 protein spots were changed between the HC and HE groups significantly. The results provided an array of changes in protein abundance in exercise-trained skeletal muscle and also provided the basis for a new hypothesis regarding the mechanism of exercise ameliorating insulin resistance.\n\n==\n\nBurniston 2008:\n\nTitle: Changes in the rat skeletal muscle proteome induced by moderate-intensity endurance exercise.\n\nAbstract: The adaptation of skeletal muscle to endurance exercise has not previously been investigated using proteomic techniques. Such work could improve our understanding and generate novel information regarding the effects of exercise. Plantaris muscles were investigated from rats exercised on treadmills at 70-75% peak oxygen uptake (V O(2)peak) for 30 min, 4 days per week for 5 weeks or sedentary controls. Analysis of 2-D gels matched 187 spots across control and exercised muscles and 80 proteins corresponding to 40 gene products were identified by MALDI-ToF MS. Exercise increased the animals' V O(2)peak by 14% and altered the expression of 15 spots consistent with a shift from glycolysis toward greater fatty-acid oxidation. The majority of differentially expressed gene products were present as multi-spot series of similar M(r) but different pI. Mitochondrial aconitase focused to 5 spots, 2 spots (pI 7.6 and 7.7) decreased (57%) whereas the pI 8.0 spot increased (51%) and was found to contain protein carbonyls. This adaptation may be related to exercise-induced oxidative stress and translocation of aconitase to mitochondrial DNA. In conclusion, proteomic techniques simultaneously demonstrated well-established effects, and identified novel changes not previously associated with the adaptation of muscle to exercise.\n\n==\n\nDeshmukh 2016:\n\nTitle: Proteomics of Skeletal Muscle: Focus on Insulin Resistance and Exercise Biology\n\nAbstract: Skeletal muscle is the largest tissue in the human body and plays an important role in locomotion and whole body metabolism. It accounts for ~80% of insulin stimulated glucose disposal. Skeletal muscle insulin resistance, a primary feature of Type 2 diabetes, is caused by a decreased ability of muscle to respond to circulating insulin. Physical exercise improves insulin sensitivity and whole body metabolism and remains one of the most promising interventions for the prevention of Type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance and exercise adaptations in skeletal muscle might be a cause, or consequence, of altered protein expressions profiles and/or their posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics offer enormous promise for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle insulin resistance and exercise-induced adaptation; however, skeletal muscle proteomics are challenging. This review describes the technical limitations of skeletal muscle proteomics as well as emerging developments in proteomics workflow with respect to samples preparation, liquid chromatography (LC), MS and computational analysis. These technologies have not yet been fully exploited in the field of skeletal muscle proteomics. Future studies that involve state-of-the-art proteomics technology will broaden our understanding of exercise-induced adaptations as well as molecular pathogenesis of insulin resistance. This could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets.\n\n==\n\nPsilander 2003:\n\nTitle: Resistance exercise alters MRF and IGF-I mRNA content in human skeletal muscle.\n\nAbstract: Increasing evidence suggests that the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and IGF-I have important roles in the hypertrophy response observed after mechanical loading. We, therefore, hypothesized that a bout of heavy-resistance training would affect the MRF and IGF-I mRNA levels in human skeletal muscle. Six male subjects completed four sets of 6-12 repetitions on a leg press and knee extensor machine separated by 3 min. Myogenin, MRF4, MyoD, IGF-IEabc (isoforms a, b, and c) and IGF-IEbc (isoform b and c) mRNA levels were determined in the vastus lateralis muscle by RT-PCR before exercise, immediately after, and 1, 2, 6, 24, and 48 h postexercise. Myogenin, MyoD, and MRF4 mRNA levels were elevated (P < 0.005) by 100-400% 0-24 h postexercise. IGF-IEabc mRNA content decreased (P < 0.005) by approximately 44% after 1 and 6 h of recovery. The IGF-IEbc mRNA level was unaffected. The present study shows that myogenin, MyoD, and MRF4 mRNA levels are transiently elevated in human skeletal muscle after a single bout of heavy-resistance training, supporting the idea that the MRFs may be involved in regulating hypertrophy and/or fiber-type transitions.

Petriz (2017) also emphasized the role of both acute and chronic exercise in muscle proteome adaptation, with aerobic and resistance training having distinct effects.\n\nPadr\u00e3o (2016) further highlighted the role of exercise in modulating the skeletal muscle proteome. The study found that chronic endurance training up-regulates the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation system, while a single bout of exercise enhances the release of calcium ion into the cytosol and amino acid metabolism. This suggests that the duration and intensity of exercise can significantly influence the proteomic response.\n\nBuford (2009) specifically highlighted the role of resistance exercise in up-regulating the transcription of numerous inflammatory mediators within skeletal muscle, suggesting a potential mechanism through which exercise may influence muscle adaptation. On the other hand, Yuan (2013) focused on the effects of aerobic exercise and found similar up-regulation of inflammatory mediators.\n\nBurniston (2008) also found that endurance exercise altered the expression of several proteins, indicating a shift from glycolysis towards greater fatty-acid oxidation.\n\nDeshmukh (2016) and Psilander (2003) both emphasized the role of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and IGF-I in muscle adaptation to resistance exercise.

These neurons, active during both observation and execution of actions, are thought to play a crucial role in imitation and other social\u2010communicative skills that are often impaired in ASD. In the current electroencephalographic study, we investigated mu suppression, indicating neural mirroring in children with ASD between the ages of 24 and 48 months and age\u2010matched typically developing children, during observation of goal\u2010directed actions and non\u2010goal\u2010directed mimicked hand movements, as well as during action execution. Results revealed no significant group differences with significant central mu suppression in the ASD children and control children during both execution and observation of goal\u2010directed actions and during observation of hand movements. Furthermore, no significant correlations between mu suppression on one hand and quality of imitation, age, and social communication questionnaire scores on the other hand were found. These findings challenge the \u201cbroken mirror\u201d hypothesis of ASD, suggesting that impaired neural mirroring is not a distinctive feature of ASD.

One neurological system proposed to underlie this function is the mirror neuron system (MNS) and previous research has suggested a dysfunctional MNS in ASD. The EEG mu frequency, more precisely the reduction of the mu power, is considered to be an index for mirror neuron functioning. In this work, EEG registrations are used to evaluate the mirror neuron functioning of twenty children with high functioning autism (HFA) between 8 and 13 years. Their mu suppression to self-executed and observed movement is compared to typically developing peers and related to age, intelligence and symptom severity. Both groups show significant mu suppression to both self and observed hand movements. No group differences are found in either condition. These results do not support the hypothesis that HFA is associated with a dysfunctional MNS. The discrepancy with previous research is discussed in light of the heterogeneity of the ASD population.\n\n==\n\nDapretto 2006:\n\nTitle: Understanding emotions in others: mirror neuron dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorders\n\nAbstract: To examine mirror neuron abnormalities in autism, high-functioning children with autism and matched controls underwent fMRI while imitating and observing emotional expressions. Although both groups performed the tasks equally well, children with autism showed no mirror neuron activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis). Notably, activity in this area was inversely related to symptom severity in the social domain, suggesting that a dysfunctional 'mirror neuron system' may underlie the social deficits observed in autism.\n\n==\n\nPerkins 2010:\n\nTitle: Mirror neuron dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders\n\nAbstract: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are developmental conditions characterized by deficits in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and obsessive/stereotyped patterns of behaviour. Although there is no reliable neurophysiological marker associated with ASDs, dysfunction of the parieto-frontal mirror neuron system has been suggested as a disturbance linked to the disorder. Mirror neurons (MNs) are visuomotor neurons which discharge both when performing and observing a goal directed action. Research suggests MNs may have a role in imitation, empathy, theory of mind and language. Although the research base is small, evidence from functional MRI, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and an electroencephalographic component called the mu rhythm suggests MNs are dysfunctional in subjects with ASD. These deficits are more pronounced when ASD subjects complete tasks with social relevance, or that are emotional in nature. Promising research has identified that interventions targeting MN related functions such as imitation can improve social functioning in ASDs. Boosting the function of MNs may improve the prognosis of ASDs, and contribute to diagnostic clarity.\n\n==\n\nEnticott 2012:\n\nTitle: Mirror Neuron Activity Associated with Social Impairments but not Age in Autism Spectrum Disorder\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe neurobiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is not particularly well understood, and biomedical treatment approaches are therefore extremely limited. A prominent explanatory model suggests that social-relating symptoms may arise from dysfunction within the mirror neuron system, while a recent neuroimaging study suggests that these impairments in ASD might reduce with age.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants with autism spectrum disorder (i.e., DSM-IV autistic disorder or Asperger's disorder) (n = 34) and matched control subjects (n = 36) completed a transcranial magnetic stimulation study in which corticospinal excitability was assessed during the observation of hand gestures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRegression analyses revealed that the ASD group presented with significantly reduced corticospinal excitability during the observation of a transitive hand gesture (relative to observation of a static hand) (p < .05), which indicates reduced putative mirror neuron system activity within ventral premotor cortex/inferior frontal gyrus. Among the ASD group, there was also a negative association between putative mirror neuron activity and self-reported social-relating impairments, but there was no indication that mirror neuron impairments in ASD decrease with age.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data provide general support for the mirror neuron hypothesis of autism; researchers now must clarify the precise functional significance of mirror neurons to truly understand their role in the neuropathophysiology of ASD and to determine whether they should be used as targets for the treatment of ASD.\n\n==\n\nWilliams 2001:\n\nTitle: Imitation, mirror neurons and autism\n\nAbstract: Various deficits in the cognitive functioning of people with autism have been documented in recent years but these provide only partial explanations for the condition. We focus instead on an imitative disturbance involving difficulties both in copying actions and in inhibiting more stereotyped mimicking, such as echolalia. A candidate for the neural basis of this disturbance may be found in a recently discovered class of neurons in frontal cortex, 'mirror neurons' (MNs). These neurons show activity in relation both to specific actions performed by self and matching actions performed by others, providing a potential bridge between minds. MN systems exist in primates without imitative and 'theory of mind' abilities and we suggest that in order for them to have become utilized to perform social cognitive functions, sophisticated cortical neuronal systems have evolved in which MNs function as key elements. Early developmental failures of MN systems are likely to result in a consequent cascade of developmental impairments characterised by the clinical syndrome of autism.\n\n==\n\nHamilton 2013:\n\nTitle: Reflecting on the mirror neuron system in autism: A systematic review of current theories\n\nAbstract: There is much interest in the claim that dysfunction of the mirror neuron system in individuals with autism spectrum condition causes difficulties in social interaction and communication. This paper systematically reviews all published studies using neuroscience methods (EEG/MEG/TMS/eyetracking/EMG/fMRI) to examine the integrity of the mirror system in autism. 25 suitable papers are reviewed. The review shows that current data are very mixed and that studies using weakly localised measures of the integrity of the mirror system are hard to interpret. The only well localised measure of mirror system function is fMRI. In fMRI studies, those using emotional stimuli have reported group differences, but studies using non-emotional hand action stimuli do not. Overall, there is little evidence for a global dysfunction of the mirror system in autism. Current data can be better understood under an alternative model in which social top-down response modulation is abnormal in autism. The implications of this model and future research directions are discussed.\n\n==\n\nFan 2010:\n\nTitle: Unbroken mirror neurons in autism spectrum disorders.\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe 'broken mirror' theory of autism, which proposes that a dysfunction of the human mirror neuron system (MNS) is responsible for the core social and cognitive deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), has received considerable attention despite weak empirical evidence.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this electroencephalographic study, we examined mu suppression, as an indicator of sensorimotor resonance, concurrent with oculomotor performance while individuals (n = 20) with ASD and control participants (n = 20) either executed hand actions or observed hand actions or a moving dot. No difference in visual attention between groups was found as indicated by fixation duration and normalized fixation number on the presented stimuli.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mu suppression over the sensorimotor cortex was significantly affected by experimental conditions, but not by group membership, nor by the interaction between groups and conditions. Individuals with ASD, similar to the controls, exhibited stronger mu suppression when watching hand actions relative to a moving dot. Notably, participants with ASD failed to imitate the observed actions while their mu suppression indicating the MNS activity was intact. In addition, the mu suppression during the observation of hand actions was positively associated with the communication competence of individuals with ASD.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur study clearly challenges the broken mirror theory of autism. The functioning of the mirror neuron system might be preserved in individuals with ASD to a certain degree. Less mu suppression to action observation coupled with more communicational severity can reflect the symptom heterogeneity of ASD. Additional research needs to be done, and more caution should be used when reaching out to the media.", "final_summary": "The relationship between mirror neurons and autism in children is a topic of considerable debate, with research yielding mixed results.

It enables objective measurement of tissue stiffness, a physical property intuitive to the human sense of touch. This novel technology has become a hotspot and plays a major role in scientific research and academic practice. Presently, ultrasound elastography has been used in the identification of benign and malignant tumors in superficial organs, such as breast and thyroid, providing clinically accurate diagnosis and treatment. The method has also been widely used for the liver, kidney, prostate, lymph nodes, blood vessels, skin and muscle system. In the application of cervical lesions, ultrasound elastography can distinguish normal cervix from abnormal cervix and differentiate benign from malignant lesions. It can significantly improve the diagnostic specificity for cervical cancer and is also useful for assessing infiltration depth and stage of cervical cancer, as well as predicting chemoradiotherapy treatment response. For cervical evaluation during pregnancy, ultrasound elastography is useful for assessing cervical softening and predicting premature delivery and outcome of induced labor. This article reviews the principles of ultrasound elastography as well as the current status and limitations in its application for cervical lesions and the cervix during pregnancy.\n\n==\n\nCui 2015:\n\nTitle: Endoscopic ultrasound elastography: Current status and future perspectives.\n\nAbstract: Elastography is a new ultrasound modality that provides images and measurements related to tissue stiffness. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has played an important role in the diagnosis and management of numerous abdominal and mediastinal diseases. Elastography by means of EUS examination can assess the elasticity of tumors in the proximity of the digestive tract that are hard to reach with conventional transcutaneous ultrasound probes, such as pancreatic masses and mediastinal or abdominal lymph nodes, thus improving the diagnostic yield of the procedure. Results from previous studies have promised benefits for EUS elastography in the differential diagnosis of lymph nodes, as well as for assessing masses with pancreatic or gastrointestinal (GI) tract locations. It is important to mention that EUS elastography is not considered a modality that can replace biopsy. However, it may be a useful adjunct, improving the accuracy of EUS-fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) by selecting the most suspicious area to be targeted. Even more, it may be useful for guiding further clinical management when EUS-FNAB is negative or inconclusive. In the present paper we will discuss the current knowledge of EUS elastography, including the technical aspects, along with its applications in the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant solid pancreatic masses and lymph nodes, as well as its aid in the differentiation between normal pancreatic tissues and chronic pancreatitis. Moreover, the emergent indication and future perspectives are summarized, such as the benefit of EUS elastography in EUS-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy, and its uses for characterization of lesions in liver, biliary tract, adrenal glands and GI tract.\n\n==\n\nSigrist 2017:\n\nTitle: Ultrasound Elastography: Review of Techniques and Clinical Applications\n\nAbstract: Elastography-based imaging techniques have received substantial attention in recent years for non-invasive assessment of tissue mechanical properties. These techniques take advantage of changed soft tissue elasticity in various pathologies to yield qualitative and quantitative information that can be used for diagnostic purposes. Measurements are acquired in specialized imaging modes that can detect tissue stiffness in response to an applied mechanical force (compression or shear wave). Ultrasound-based methods are of particular interest due to its many inherent advantages, such as wide availability including at the bedside and relatively low cost. Several ultrasound elastography techniques using different excitation methods have been developed. In general, these can be classified into strain imaging methods that use internal or external compression stimuli, and shear wave imaging that use ultrasound-generated traveling shear wave stimuli. While ultrasound elastography has shown promising results for non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis, new applications in breast, thyroid, prostate, kidney and lymph node imaging are emerging. Here, we review the basic principles, foundation physics, and limitations of ultrasound elastography and summarize its current clinical use and ongoing developments in various clinical applications.\n\n==\n\nSarvazyan 2011:\n\nTitle: AN OVERVIEW OF ELASTOGRAPHY - AN EMERGING BRANCH OF MEDICAL IMAGING.\n\nAbstract: From times immemorial manual palpation served as a source of information on the state of soft tissues and allowed detection of various diseases accompanied by changes in tissue elasticity. During the last two decades, the ancient art of palpation gained new life due to numerous emerging elasticity imaging (EI) methods. Areas of applications of EI in medical diagnostics and treatment monitoring are steadily expanding. Elasticity imaging methods are emerging as commercial applications, a true testament to the progress and importance of the field.In this paper we present a brief history and theoretical basis of EI, describe various techniques of EI and, analyze their advantages and limitations, and overview main clinical applications. We present a classification of elasticity measurement and imaging techniques based on the methods used for generating a stress in the tissue (external mechanical force, internal ultrasound radiation force, or an internal endogenous force), and measurement of the tissue response. The measurement method can be performed using differing physical principles including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound imaging, X-ray imaging, optical and acoustic signals.Until recently, EI was largely a research method used by a few select institutions having the special equipment needed to perform the studies. Since 2005 however, increasing numbers of mainstream manufacturers have added EI to their ultrasound systems so that today the majority of manufacturers offer some sort of Elastography or tissue stiffness imaging on their clinical systems. Now it is safe to say that some sort of elasticity imaging may be performed on virtually all types of focal and diffuse disease. Most of the new applications are still in the early stages of research, but a few are becoming common applications in clinical practice.\n\n==\n\nDudea-Simon 2020:\n\nTitle: Elastography of the uterine cervix in gynecology: normal appearance, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer.

All studies, fully-available in English, assessing elastography of the uterine cervix in CC and CIN were selected. Studies were reviewed and discussed according to the elastographic technique and to the purpose of the research.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-three articles were found: 11 articles regarding strain elastography, 4 articles assessing shear wave elastography and 8 papers with matter-related information. Elastography was used in the study of normal variants of the uterine cervix as well as: the positive diagnosis of CC and CIN, clinical staging and the prediction of therapeutic response in CC. Comparison of the elastographic techniques was also performed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nElastography has multiple applications in the gynecological pathology of the cervix. The methods used to assess the cervix are diverse, and none have become universally accepted.

The Bishop score has been used to evaluate the cervix during pregnancy. However, alternatives have been evaluated because the Bishop score is uncomfortable for patients, relies on a subjective examination, and lacks internal os data. Elastography has been used to assess the cervix, as it can estimate tissue stiffness. Recent articles on elastography for cervical assessment during pregnancy have focused on its usefulness for prediction of preterm birth and successful labor induction. There is a clinical need for cervical elastography, as an evaluation of biomechanical factors, because cervical length only assesses morphological changes. However, until now, cervical elastography has been studied in the limited field, and not shown a uniformed methodological technique. In this review, the current status, limitations, and future possibility of cervical elastography were discussed. Future studies should focus on overcoming the limitations of cervical elastography. Although the cervical elastography is presently an incompletely defined technique, it needs to be improved and evaluated as a method for use in combination with cervical length.\n\n==\n\nKozma 2021:\n\nTitle: Application of ultrasound elastography in obstetrics and gynecology\n\nAbstract: \u00d6sszefoglal\u00f3.

The advantage of ultrasound elastography lies in the fact that two different tissues can share similar echogenicities but may have other mechanical properties or, on the contrary, mechanical abnormalities of a designated tissue do not necessarily go hand in hand with an altered appearance on a conventional ultrasound image. In the last decade, strain and shear-wave elasticity imaging methods have become the most widely available among commercial ultrasound equipments. The importance of this new method expands rapidly also in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. Ultrasound elastography has a promising role in the diagnosis of endometriosis and adenomyosis and helps to differentiate benign and malignant cervical and ovarian lesions. The use in the prediction of the outcome of labor induction and preterm birth, and in the evaluation of preeclampsia are emerging.

The method is based on external tissue compression, with subsequent computation of the strain profile along the transducer axis, which is derived from cross-correlation analysis of pre- and post-compression A-line pairs. The strain profile can then be converted to an elastic modulus profile by measuring the stresses applied by the compressing device and applying certain corrections for the nonuniform stress field.

Guba\u2019s constructs, in particular, have won considerable favour and form the focus of this paper. Here researchers seek to satisfy four criteria. In addressing credibility, investigators attempt to demonstrate that a true picture of the phenomenon under scrutiny is being presented. To allow transferability, they provide sufficient detail of the context of the fieldwork for a reader to be able to decide whether the prevailing environment is similar to another situation with which he or she is familiar and whether the findings can justifiably be applied to the other setting. The meeting of the dependability criterion is difficult in qualitative work, although researchers should at least strive to enable a future investigator to repeat the study.

Given this increase, it is important to provide guidance to assist researchers in ensuring quality when employing such methods. This commentary addresses both theoretical fundamentals as well as practical aspects of establishing quality in qualitative social pharmacy research. More specifically, it provides an explanation of each of the criteria of trustworthiness proposed by Lincoln and Guba (credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability) and different techniques used in establishing them. It also provides a brief overview of authenticity, a more recent and less widely used set of criteria that involve demonstrating fairness, ontological authenticity, educative authenticity, catalytic authenticity, and tactical authenticity. For each of these terms, the commentary provides a definition, how it applies to social pharmacy research, and guidance on when and how to use them.

This overview examines ways of enhancing the quality and credibility of qualitative analysis by dealing with three distinct but related inquiry concerns: rigorous techniques and methods for gathering and analyzing qualitative data, including attention to validity, reliability, and triangulation; the credibility, competence, and perceived trustworthiness of the qualitative researcher; and the philosophical beliefs of evaluation users about such paradigm-based preferences as objectivity versus subjectivity, truth versus perspective, and generalizations versus extrapolations. Although this overview examines some general approaches to issues of credibility and data quality in qualitative analysis, it is important to acknowledge that particular philosophical underpinnings, specific paradigms, and special purposes for qualitative inquiry will typically include additional or substitute criteria for assuring and judging quality, validity, and credibility. Moreover, the context for these considerations has evolved. In early literature on evaluation methods the debate between qualitative and quantitative methodologists was often strident. In recent years the debate has softened. A consensus has gradually emerged that the important challenge is to match appropriately the methods to empirical questions and issues, and not to universally advocate any single methodological approach for all problems.\n\n==\n\nJones 2013:\n\nTitle: Authenticity and scientific integrity in qualitative research.\n\nAbstract: Jacqueline Jones, PhD, RN, FRCNA, is an associate professor in the Division of Informatics, Health Systems & Leadership, College of Nursing University of Colorado, Aurora, CO. Scholarship for the care of women, childbearing families, and newborns demands attention to detail, creativity, and purpose in inquiry. A perplexing question is often raised by nurse scientists: Is qualitative research relevant today? A brief survey of a funding search engine, RePORTer, provided a resounding answer in the affirmative (1,470 hits with the term qualitative). Qualitative research makes a contribution to the contemporary development of health-related knowledge for individuals, families, communities, and populations. Qualitative research can help identify facilitators and barriers to intervention and can assist in the development of health care policy (Sandelowski & Leeman, 2012). It helps bring richness, context, and dimension to the study of human beings and their environments.\n\n==\n\nMorrow 2005:\n\nTitle: Quality and trustworthiness in qualitative research in counseling psychology.\n\nAbstract: This article examines concepts of the trustworthiness, or credibility, of qualitative research. Following a \u201cresearcher-as-instrument,\u201d or self-reflective, statement, the paradigmatic underpinnings of various criteria for judging the quality of qualitative research are explored, setting the stage for a discussion of more transcendent standards (those not associated with specific paradigms) for conducting quality research: social validity, subjectivity and reflexivity, adequacy of data, and adequacy of interpretation. Finally, current guidelines for writing and publishing qualitative research are reviewed, and strategies for conducting and writing qualitative research reports are suggested. Qualitative research, ensuing from a variety of disciplines, paradigms, and epistemologies, embraces multiple standards of quality, known variously as validity, credibility, rigor ,o rtrustworthiness. In addition to some standards that may be thought of as somewhat universal across disciplines and paradigms, the \u201cgoodness\u201d (Morrow & Smith, 2000) of qualitative inquiry is assessed on the basis of the paradigmatic underpinnings of the research and the standards of the discipline. Thus, a grounded theory study or a consensual qualitative research investigation in counseling psychology that is rooted in a postpositivist or constructivist/interpretivist paradigm will look quite different from a critical ethnography in education; and the standards appropriate for evaluating these studies will vary accordingly. I begin this article by addressing the paradigmatic underpinnings of trustworthiness or rigor in qualitative research. Next, I discuss central topics related to trustworthiness or validity that span paradigms and may be thought of as relevant across most research designs. I then provide an overview of guidelines that have been suggested for evaluating qualitative research, particularly in psychology. Finally, I offer recommendations for enhancing the quality of qualitative research in counseling psychology and suggest strategies for writing and publishing. First, however, in keeping with the standard of reflexivity as a way for researchers to inform their audiences about their perspectives as well as to manage their subjectivities, I describe my own assumptions about qualitative research methodology and quality.\n\n==\n\nNoble 2015:\n\nTitle: Issues of validity and reliability in qualitative research\n\nAbstract: Evaluating the quality of research is essential if findings are to be utilised in practice and incorporated into care delivery. In a previous article we explored \u2018bias\u2019 across research designs and outlined strategies to minimise bias.1 The aim of this article is to further outline rigour, or the integrity in which a study is conducted, and ensure the credibility of findings in relation to qualitative research. Concepts such as reliability, validity and generalisability typically associated with quantitative research and alternative terminology will be compared in relation to their application to qualitative research. In addition, some of the strategies adopted by qualitative researchers to enhance the credibility of their research are outlined.\n\nAssessing the reliability of study findings requires researchers and health professionals to make judgements about the \u2018soundness\u2019 of the research in relation to \u2026\n\n==\n\nBeck 1993:\n\nTitle: Qualitative Research: The Evaluation of Its Credibility, Fittingness, and Auditability\n\nAbstract: The three criteria of credibility, fittingness, and auditability have been focused on in the hope of facilitating the critique of qualitative research. Once criteria that are appropriate to qualitative methodologies are developed, the scientific merit of these research studies can truly be appreciated. If traditional scientific criteria relevant to quantitative studies are used to critique qualitative methods, the development and acceptance of this paradigm-transcending research will be hindered.", "final_summary": "Credibility and reliability are fundamental aspects of conducting qualitative research, ensuring that the findings are trustworthy (Brink, 1993). These aspects are particularly crucial in qualitative research, where the researcher's subjectivity can potentially cloud data interpretation (Brink, 1993).\n\nStrategies for ensuring trustworthiness in qualitative research include demonstrating a true picture of the phenomenon under scrutiny (credibility), providing sufficient context for the research (transferability), enabling future investigators to repeat the study (dependability), and demonstrating that findings emerge from the data and not from the researcher's predispositions (confirmability) (Shenton, 2004; Amin, 2020).\n\nAuthenticity, a less widely used set of criteria, involves demonstrating fairness, ontological authenticity, educative authenticity, catalytic authenticity, and tactical authenticity (Amin, 2020). \n\nThe quality and credibility of qualitative analysis can be enhanced by rigorous techniques and methods for gathering and analyzing data, including attention to validity, reliability, and triangulation (Patton, 1999). The credibility of the researcher and the philosophical beliefs of evaluation users also play a significant role in enhancing the quality of qualitative research (Patton, 1999).\n\nTrustworthiness in qualitative research can be achieved through social validity, subjectivity and reflexivity, adequacy of data, and adequacy of interpretation (Morrow, 2005). Evaluating the quality of research is essential for the findings to be utilized in practice and incorporated into care delivery (Noble, 2015).\n\nIn conclusion, credibility and reliability in qualitative research are achieved through a combination of rigorous methods, researcher credibility, and the application of appropriate criteria for trustworthiness. These aspects ensure that the findings of qualitative research are trustworthy (Beck, 1993)."}, {"query": "Genome mining for bioactive secondary metabolites from microbes", "paper_list_string": "Arulprakasam 2021:\n\nTitle: Genome mining of biosynthetic gene clusters intended for secondary metabolites conservation in actinobacteria.\n\nAbstract: Evolution of genome sequencing technology, on the one hand, and advancement of computational genome mining tools, on the other hand, paves way for improvement in predicting secondary metabolites. In past, numerous efforts were made concerning genome mining for recognizing secondary metabolites within the genus, but only a negligible quantity of comparative genomic reports had carried out among species of different genera. In this study, we explored potential of 24 actinobacteria species belonging to the genera, including Streptomyces, Nocardia, Micromonospora, and Saccharomonospora, to traverse diversity and distribution of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs). Investigating results obtained from antiSMASH (Antibiotics and Secondary Metabolites Analysis Shell), NaPDoS (Natural Product Domain Seeker), and NP.searcher revealed conservation of genus-specific gene clusters among various species. E.g., NAGGN (n-acetyl glutaminyl glutamine amide) is present in Micromonospora, furan in Nocardia, melanin, and lassopeptide occur in Streptomyces. Bioactive compounds like alkyl-O-dihydro geranyl methoxy hydroquinone, SapB, desferrioxamine E, 2-Methylisoborneol, mayamycin, cyclodipeptide synthase, diisonitrile, salinichelin, hopene, ectoine and isorenieratene are highly conserved among diverse genera. Furthermore, pharmacological activity of actinobacterial derived metabolites against bacterial and fungal pathogens were illustrated.

In recent years, genome mining has seen broad applications in identifying and characterizing new compounds as well as in metabolic engineering. Since 2011, the \u2018antibiotics and secondary metabolite analysis shell\u2014antiSMASH\u2019 (https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org) has assisted researchers in this, both as a web server and a standalone tool. It has established itself as the most widely used tool for identifying and analysing biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in bacterial and fungal genome sequences. Here, we present an entirely redesigned and extended version 5 of antiSMASH. antiSMASH 5 adds detection rules for clusters encoding the biosynthesis of acyl-amino acids, \u03b2-lactones, fungal RiPPs, RaS-RiPPs, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, C-nucleosides, PPY-like ketones and lipolanthines. For type II polyketide synthase-encoding gene clusters, antiSMASH 5 now offers more detailed predictions. The HTML output visualization has been redesigned to improve the navigation and visual representation of annotations. We have again improved the runtime of analysis steps, making it possible to deliver comprehensive annotations for bacterial genomes within a few minutes. A new output file in the standard JavaScript object notation (JSON) format is aimed at downstream tools that process antiSMASH results programmatically.\n\n==\n\nBelknap 2020:\n\nTitle: Genome mining of biosynthetic and chemotherapeutic gene clusters in Streptomyces bacteria\n\nAbstract: Streptomyces bacteria are known for their prolific production of secondary metabolites, many of which have been widely used in human medicine, agriculture and animal health. To guide the effective prioritization of specific biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for drug development and targeting the most prolific producer strains, knowledge about phylogenetic relationships of Streptomyces species, genome-wide diversity and distribution patterns of BGCs is critical. We used genomic and phylogenetic methods to elucidate the diversity of major classes of BGCs in 1,110 publicly available Streptomyces genomes. Genome mining of Streptomyces reveals high diversity of BGCs and variable distribution patterns in the Streptomyces phylogeny, even among very closely related strains. The most common BGCs are non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, type 1 polyketide synthases, terpenes, and lantipeptides. We also found that numerous Streptomyces species harbor BGCs known to encode antitumor compounds. We observed that strains that are considered the same species can vary tremendously in the BGCs they carry, suggesting that strain-level genome sequencing can uncover high levels of BGC diversity and potentially useful derivatives of any one compound. These findings suggest that a strain-level strategy for exploring secondary metabolites for clinical use provides an alternative or complementary approach to discovering novel pharmaceutical compounds from microbes.\n\n==\n\nKhoshakhlagh 2022:\n\nTitle: Investigation of diverse biosynthetic secondary metabolites gene clusters using genome mining of indigenous Streptomyces strains isolated from saline soils in Iran\n\nAbstract: Background and Objectives: Bioactive secondary metabolites are the products of microbial communities adapting to environmental challenges, which have yet remained anonymous. As a result of demands in the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and food industries, microbial metabolites should be investigated. The most substantial sources of secondary metabolites are Streptomyces strains and are potential candidates for bioactive compound production. So, we used genome mining and bioinformatics to predict the isolates secondary metabolites, biosynthesis, and potential pharmaceuticals. Materials and Methods: This is a bioinformatics part of our previous experimental research. Here, we aimed to inspect the underlying secondary metabolite properties of 20 phylogenetically diverse Streptomyces species of saline soil by a rationalized computational workflow by several software tools. We examined the Metabolites\u2019 cytotoxicity and antibacterial effects using the MTT assay and plate count technique, respectively. Results: Among Streptomyces species, three were selected for genome mining and predicted novel secondary metabolites and potential drug abilities. All 11 metabolites were cytotoxic to A549, but ectoine (p\u22640.5) and geosmin (p\u22640.001) significantly operated as an anti-cancer drug. Metabolites of oxytetracycline and phosphinothricin (p\u22640.001), 4Z-annimycin and geosmin (p\u22640.01), and ectoine (p\u22640.5) revealed significant antibacterial activity. Conclusion: Of all the 11 compounds investigated, annimycin, geosmin, phosphinothricin, and ectoine had antimicrobial properties, but geosmin also showed very significant anti-cancer properties.\n\n==\n\nZiemert 2016:\n\nTitle: The evolution of genome mining in microbes - a review.\n\nAbstract: Covering: 2006 to 2016The computational mining of genomes has become an important part in the discovery of novel natural products as drug leads. Thousands of bacterial genome sequences are publically available these days containing an even larger number and diversity of secondary metabolite gene clusters that await linkage to their encoded natural products. With the development of high-throughput sequencing methods and the wealth of DNA data available, a variety of genome mining methods and tools have been developed to guide discovery and characterisation of these compounds. This article reviews the development of these computational approaches during the last decade and shows how the revolution of next generation sequencing methods has led to an evolution of various genome mining approaches, techniques and tools. After a short introduction and brief overview of important milestones, this article will focus on the different approaches of mining genomes for secondary metabolites, from detecting biosynthetic genes to resistance based methods and \"evo-mining\" strategies including a short evaluation of the impact of the development of genome mining methods and tools on the field of natural products and microbial ecology.\n\n==\n\nMicallef 2015:\n\nTitle: Genome mining for natural product biosynthetic gene clusters in the Subsection V cyanobacteria\n\nAbstract: BackgroundCyanobacteria are well known for the production of a range of secondary metabolites. Whilst recent genome sequencing projects has led to an increase in the number of publically available cyanobacterial genomes, the secondary metabolite potential of many of these organisms remains elusive. Our study focused on the 11 publically available Subsection V cyanobacterial genomes, together with the draft genomes of Westiella intricata UH strain HT-29-1 and Hapalosiphon welwitschii UH strain IC-52-3, for their genetic potential to produce secondary metabolites. The Subsection V cyanobacterial genomes analysed in this study are reported to produce a diverse range of natural products, including the hapalindole-family of compounds, microcystin, hapalosin, mycosporine-like amino acids and hydrocarbons.ResultsA putative gene cluster for the cyclic depsipeptide hapalosin, known to reverse P-glycoprotein multiple drug resistance, was identified within three Subsection V cyanobacterial genomes, including the producing cyanobacterium H. welwitschii UH strain IC-52-3. A number of orphan NRPS/PKS gene clusters and ribosomally-synthesised and post translationally-modified peptide gene clusters (including cyanobactin, microviridin and bacteriocin gene clusters) were identified. Furthermore, gene clusters encoding the biosynthesis of mycosporine-like amino acids, scytonemin, hydrocarbons and terpenes were also identified and compared.ConclusionsGenome mining has revealed the diversity, abundance and complex nature of the secondary metabolite potential of the Subsection V cyanobacteria. This bioinformatic study has identified novel biosynthetic enzymes which have not been associated with gene clusters of known classes of natural products, suggesting that these cyanobacteria potentially produce structurally novel secondary metabolites.\n\n==\n\nRomsdahl 2019:\n\nTitle: Recent advances in the genome mining of Aspergillus secondary metabolites (covering 2012-2018).\n\nAbstract: Secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by filamentous fungi possess diverse bioactivities that make them excellent drug candidates. Whole genome sequencing has revealed that fungi have the capacity to produce a far greater number of SMs than have been isolated, since many of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis are either silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions. There has been significant effort to activate SM biosynthetic genes and link them to their downstream products, as the SMs produced by these \"cryptic\" pathways offer a promising source for new drug discovery. Further, an understanding of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis facilitates product yield optimization of first-generation molecules and genetic engineering of second-generation analogs. This review covers advances made in genome mining SMs produced by Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus terreus in the past six years (2012-2018). Genetic identification and molecular characterization of SM biosynthetic gene clusters, along with proposed biosynthetic pathways, will be discussed in depth.\n\n==\n\nBok 2006:\n\nTitle: Genomic mining for Aspergillus natural products.\n\nAbstract: The genus Aspergillus is renowned for its ability to produce a myriad of bioactive secondary metabolites. Although the propensity of biosynthetic genes to form contiguous clusters greatly facilitates assignment of putative secondary metabolite genes in the completed Aspergillus genomes, such analysis cannot predict gene expression and, ultimately, product formation. To circumvent this deficiency, we have examined Aspergillus nidulans microarrays for expressed secondary metabolite gene clusters by using the transcriptional regulator LaeA. Deletion or overexpression of laeA clearly identified numerous secondary metabolite clusters. A gene deletion in one of the clusters eliminated the production of the antitumor compound terrequinone A, a metabolite not described, from A. nidulans. In this paper, we highlight that LaeA-based genome mining helps decipher the secondary metabolome of Aspergilli and provides an unparalleled view to assess secondary metabolism gene regulation.", "final_summary": "Genome mining has emerged as a powerful tool for the discovery of bioactive secondary metabolites from microbes, particularly in the field of drug discovery.

While constructivists acknowledge there is a biological dimension to emotion, they deny that emotions are (or involve) affect programs. So they also deny emotions are natural kinds. However, the essential role that constructivism gives to felt experience and folk concepts leads to an account that is extensionally inadequate and functionally inaccurate. Moreover, biologically oriented proposals that reject these commitments are not similarly encumbered. Recognizing this has two implications: biological mechanisms are more central to emotion than constructivism allows, and the conclusion that emotions are not natural kinds is premature.\n\n==\n\nLindquist 2013:\n\nTitle: The hundred-year emotion war: are emotions natural kinds or psychological constructions? Comment on Lench, Flores, and Bench (2011).\n\nAbstract: For the last century, there has been a continuing debate about the nature of emotion. In the most recent offering in this scientific dialogue, Lench, Flores, and Bench (2011) reported a meta-analysis of emotion induction research and claimed support for the natural kind hypothesis that discrete emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, and anxiety) elicit specific changes in cognition, judgment, behavior, experience, and physiology. In this article, we point out that Lench et al. (2011) is not the final word on the emotion debate. First, we point out that Lench et al.'s findings do not support their claim that discrete emotions organize cognition, judgment, experience, and physiology because they did not demonstrate emotion-consistent and emotion-specific directional changes in these measurement domains. Second, we point out that Lench et al.'s findings are in fact consistent with the alternative (a psychological constructionist approach to emotion). We close by appealing for a construct validity approach to emotion research, which we hope will lead to greater consensus on the operationalization of the natural kind and psychological construction approaches, as well as the criteria required to finally resolve the emotion debate.\n\n==\n\nAverill 1980:\n\nTitle: A CONSTRUCTIVIST VIEW OF EMOTION\n\nAbstract: ABSTRACT Traditionally, the emotions have been viewed from a biological perspective; that is, the emotions have been seen as genetically determined and relatively invariable responses. The present chapter, by contrast, views the emotions as social constructions. More precisely, the emotions are here defined as socially constituted syndromes or transitory social roles. A role-conception does not deny the contribution of biological systems to emotional syndromes; it does, however, imply that the functional significance of emotional responses is to be found largely within the sociocultural system. With regard to subjective experience, a person interprets his own behavior as emotional in much the same way that an actor interprets a role\u201cwith feeling.\u201d This involves not only the monitoring of behavior (including feedback from physiological arousal, facial expressions, etc.), but also an understanding of how the emotional role fits into a larger\u201cdrama\u201d written by society. Some of the biological, personal, and situational factors that influence emotional behavior are also discussed.\n\n==\n\nBarrett 2016:\n\nTitle: The theory of constructed emotion: an active inference account of interoception and categorization\n\nAbstract: Abstract The science of emotion has been using folk psychology categories derived from philosophy to search for the brain basis of emotion. The last two decades of neuroscience research have brought us to the brink of a paradigm shift in understanding the workings of the brain, however, setting the stage to revolutionize our understanding of what emotions are and how they work. In this article, we begin with the structure and function of the brain, and from there deduce what the biological basis of emotions might be. The answer is a brain-based, computational account called the theory of constructed emotion.\n\n==\n\nOno 2014:\n\nTitle: How are innate emotions evoked?\n\nAbstract: We read with great interest the book and its precis by Rolls (2014a,b). He defines emotions as states in organisms that are elicited by reinforcements (rewards and punishments) and motivation as a state in which organisms are working for a goal to acquire or avoid reinforcements. Based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution (1859), Rolls proposes that emotions have an important evolutionary role in specifying a goal (rewards) (e.g., rewards that elicit positive emotions are necessary for the survival of organisms). According to Rolls\u2019 theory, neural mechanisms are hierarchically implemented in cortical systems. Stimuli (objects) are consciously represented in the higher association areas, such as the inferotemporal cortex, and this information is then sent to the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex that code emotions and the emotional values of the stimuli. Finally, the value information is transferred to other areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex and basal ganglia, in order to select optimal actions required to acquire rewards. These theories elegantly explain human conscious emotions and behaviors. Furthermore, the theories and hypotheses for human higher cognitive and conscious processes proposed in the book can be testable by computer simulation. This method could uncover the neural mechanisms of emotions in humans at the cellular and system levels. We completely agree with the Darwinian account of emotion (Ono & Nishijo, 1992), as Rolls has proposed. In addition to the cortical systems that Rolls says is important for emotion processing, we would like to stress a role of subcortical sensory systems, such as subcortical fear modules (LeDoux, 2012), in unconscious innate emotions, which might also affect behavior and decision making in primates. Rolls has suggested that early stages in sensory processing may evoke emotional responses in non-primates, such as rodents. We similarly suggest that the phylogenetically old subcortical\n\n==\n\nBarrett 2006:\n\nTitle: Are Emotions Natural Kinds?\n\nAbstract: Laypeople and scientists alike believe that they know anger, or sadness, or fear, when they see it. These emotions and a few others are presumed to have specific causal mechanisms in the brain and properties that are observable (on the face, in the voice, in the body, or in experience)\u2014that is, they are assumed to be natural kinds. If a given emotion is a natural kind and can be identified objectively, then it is possible to make discoveries about that emotion. Indeed, the scientific study of emotion is founded on this assumption. In this article, I review the accumulating empirical evidence that is inconsistent with the view that there are kinds of emotion with boundaries that are carved in nature. I then consider what moving beyond a natural-kind view might mean for the scientific understanding of emotion.\n\n==\n\nScherer 2009:\n\nTitle: Emotions are emergent processes: they require a dynamic computational architecture\n\nAbstract: Emotion is a cultural and psychobiological adaptation mechanism which allows each individual to react flexibly and dynamically to environmental contingencies. From this claim flows a description of the elements theoretically needed to construct a virtual agent with the ability to display human-like emotions and to respond appropriately to human emotional expression. This article offers a brief survey of the desirable features of emotion theories that make them ideal blueprints for agent models. In particular, the component process model of emotion is described, a theory which postulates emotion-antecedent appraisal on different levels of processing that drive response system patterning predictions. In conclusion, investing seriously in emergent computational modelling of emotion using a nonlinear dynamic systems approach is suggested.\n\n==\n\nGriffiths 1997:\n\nTitle: What emotions really are : the problem of psychological categories\n\nAbstract: This study argues that much research of the emotions has been misguided. It attempts to show that \"emotion\" encompasses psychological states of very different, and thus not comparable, kinds. Some emotions, such as a brief flaring up of anger in response to some experience, are evolutionary ancient, reflex-like responses which appear insensitive to culture. Others, like moral guilt, differ importantly across cultures, despite their long history in humans, and affinity to behaviour seen in other species. Yet other emotions appear to be the acting-out of today's psychological myths, as ghost possession acted out the metaphysical myths of past centuries. These three kinds of responses have different evolutionary origins, different adaptive functions, different biological bases, and different roles in human psychology. The concept that binds them together, emotion, plays no useful role, since there is no object of scientific knowledge that corresponds to it. A detailed overview of the relevant theoretical approaches is provided in this text, assessing the relative merits of three main theoretical approaches: affect programme theory, evolutionary psychology, and social constructionism.", "final_summary": "The debate on whether emotions are innate or constructed is a complex and multifaceted one, with scholars presenting compelling arguments on both sides. \n\nOn one hand, some researchers argue that emotions are psychological constructions. Lindquist (2013) and Averill (1980) both propose that emotions are not natural kinds, but rather social constructs that are influenced by cultural and societal factors. Similarly, Barrett (2016) and Barrett (2006) propose a theory of constructed emotion, suggesting that emotions are not biologically predetermined but are instead constructed based on individual experiences and perceptions.\n\nOn the other hand, some researchers argue for the innate nature of emotions. Kurth (2019) criticizes the constructivist view, arguing that biological mechanisms play a more central role in emotions than constructivism allows. Ono (2014) also leans towards the innate perspective, suggesting that emotions have an evolutionary role and are elicited by reinforcements.\n\nHowever, some researchers propose a more nuanced view that integrates both perspectives. Scherer (2009) suggests that emotions are emergent processes, implying a dynamic interplay between innate biological mechanisms and constructed elements. Similarly, Griffiths (1997) argues that the concept of emotion encompasses psychological states of different kinds, some of which are evolutionary ancient and reflex-like, while others differ across cultures or are the acting-out of psychological myths.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate on whether emotions are innate or constructed is far from settled.

This study identified relationships between multiple types of adverse events and distinct categories of adolescent violence perpetration. METHODS: Data are from 136 549 students in the 6th, 9th, and 12th grades who responded to the 2007 Minnesota Student Survey, an anonymous, self-report survey examining youth health behaviors and perceptions, characteristics of primary socializing domains, and youth engagement. Linear and logistic regression models were used to determine if 6 types of adverse experiences including physical abuse, sexual abuse by family and/or other persons, witnessing abuse, and household dysfunction caused by family alcohol and/or drug use were significantly associated with risk of adolescent violence perpetration after adjustment for demographic covariates. An adverse-events score was entered into regression models to test for a dose-response relationship between the event score and violence outcomes. All analyses were stratified according to gender. RESULTS: More than 1 in 4 youth (28.9%) reported at least 1 adverse childhood experience. The most commonly reported adverse experience was alcohol abuse by a household family member that caused problems. Each type of adverse childhood experience was significantly associated with adolescent interpersonal violence perpetration (delinquency, bullying, physical fighting, dating violence, weapon-carrying on school property) and self-directed violence (self-mutilatory behavior, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt). For each additional type of adverse event reported by youth, the risk of violence perpetration increased 35% to 144%. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple types of adverse childhood experiences should be considered as risk factors for a spectrum of violence-related outcomes during adolescence. Providers and advocates should be aware of the interrelatedness and cumulative impact of adverse-event types. Study findings support broadening the current discourse on types of adverse events when considering pathways from child maltreatment to adolescent perpetration of delinquent and violent outcomes.\n\n==\n\nRivera 1990:\n\nTitle: Childhood Victimization and Violent Offending\n\nAbstract: The relationship between childhood victimization and violent offending is examined using a prospective cohorts design. Official criminal histories for a large sample of substantiated and validated cases of physical and sexual abuse and neglect (N = 908) from the years 1967 through 1971 were compared to those of a matched control group (N = 667) of individuals with no official record of abuse or neglect. Sex-specific and race-specific effects of childhood victimization and other characteristics of violent offending (chronicity, age of onset, temporal patterns, and continuity) are assessed. Childhood victimization increased overall risk for violent offending and particularly increased risk for males and blacks. In comparison to controls, abused and neglected children began delinquent careers earlier. Temporal patterns of violent offending were examined and childhood victims did not differ in age of arrest for first violent offense, nor were they more likely to continue offending. The findings and their limitations are discussed, as well as directions for future research.\n\n==\n\nFinkelhor 2009:\n\nTitle: Violence, Abuse, and Crime Exposure in a National Sample of Children and Youth\n\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to obtain national estimates of exposure to the full spectrum of the childhood violence, abuse, and crime victimizations relevant to both clinical practice and public-policy approaches to the problem. METHODS: The study was based on a cross-sectional national telephone survey that involved a target sample of 4549 children aged 0 to 17 years. RESULTS: A clear majority (60.6%) of the children and youth in this nationally representative sample had experienced at least 1 direct or witnessed victimization in the previous year. Almost half (46.3%) had experienced a physical assault in the study year, 1 in 4 (24.6%) had experienced a property offense, 1 in 10 (10.2%) had experienced a form of child maltreatment, 6.1% had experienced a sexual victimization, and more than 1 in 4 (25.3%) had been a witness to violence or experienced another form of indirect victimization in the year, including 9.8% who had witnessed an intrafamily assault. One in 10 (10.2%) had experienced a victimization-related injury. More than one third (38.7%) had been exposed to 2 or more direct victimizations, 10.9% had 5 or more, and 2.4% had 10 or more during the study year. CONCLUSIONS: The scope and diversity of child exposure to victimization is not well recognized. Clinicians and researchers need to inquire about a larger spectrum of victimization types to identify multiply victimized children and tailor prevention and interventions to the full range of threats that children face.\n\n==\n\nFinkelhor 2013:\n\nTitle: Violence, crime, and abuse exposure in a national sample of children and youth: an update.\n\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nBecause exposure to violence, crime, and abuse has been shown to have serious consequences on child development, physicians and policymakers need to know the kinds of exposure that occur at various developmental stages.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo provide updated estimates of and trends for childhood exposure to a broad range of violence, crime, and abuse victimizations.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence was based on a cross-sectional, US national telephone survey conducted in 2011.\n\n\nSETTING\nInterviews by telephone.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nThe experiences of 4503 children and youth aged 1 month to 17 years were assessed by interviews with caregivers and with youth in the case of those aged 10 to 17 years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo-fifths (41.2%) of children and youth experienced a physical assault in the last year, and 1 in 10 (10.1%) experienced an assault-related injury. Two percent experienced sexual assault or sexual abuse in the last year, but the rate was 10.7% for girls aged 14 to 17 years. More than 1 in 10 (13.7%) experienced maltreatment by a caregiver, including 3.7% who experienced physical abuse. Few significant changes could be detected in rates since an equivalent survey in 2008, but declines were documented in peer flashing, school bomb threats, juvenile sibling assault, and robbery and total property victimization.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe variety and scope of children's exposure to violence, crime, and abuse suggest the need for better and more comprehensive tools in clinical and research settings for identifying these experiences and their effects.\n\n==\n\nFinkelhor 2015:\n\nTitle: Prevalence of Childhood Exposure to Violence, Crime, and Abuse: Results From the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence.\n\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nIt is important to estimate the burden of and trends for violence, crime, and abuse in the lives of children.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo provide health care professionals, policy makers, and parents with current estimates of exposure to violence, crime, and abuse across childhood and at different developmental stages.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThe National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence (NatSCEV) includes a representative sample of US telephone numbers from August 28, 2013, to April 30, 2014. Via telephone interviews, information was obtained on 4000 children 0 to 17 years old, with information about exposure to violence, crime, and abuse provided by youth 10 to 17 years old and by caregivers for children 0 to 9 years old.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE\nExposure to violence, crime, and abuse using the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn total, 37.3% of youth experienced a physical assault in the study year, and 9.3% of youth experienced an assault-related injury. Two percent of girls experienced sexual assault or sexual abuse in the study year, while the rate was 4.6% for girls 14 to 17 years old. Overall, 15.2% of children and youth experienced maltreatment by a caregiver, including 5.0% who experienced physical abuse. In total, 5.8% witnessed an assault between parents. Only 2 significant rate changes could be detected compared with the last survey in 2011, namely, declines in past-year exposure to dating violence and lifetime exposure to household theft.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nChildren and youth are exposed to violence, abuse, and crime in varied and extensive ways, which justifies continued monitoring and prevention efforts.\n\n==\n\nFinkelhor 2005:\n\nTitle: The Victimization of Children and Youth: A Comprehensive, National Survey\n\nAbstract: This study examined a large spectrum of violence, crime, and victimization experiences in a nationally representative sample of children and youth ages 2 to 17 years. More than one half (530 per 1,000) of the children and youth had experienced a physical assault in the study year, more than 1 in 4 (273 per 1,000) a property offense, more than 1 in 8 (136 per 1,000) a form of child maltreatment, 1 in 12 (82 per 1,000) a sexual victimization, and more than 1 in 3 (357 per 1,000) had been a witness to violence or experienced another form of indirect victimization. Only a minority (29%) had no direct or indirect victimization. The mean number of victimizations for a child or youth with any victimization was 3.0, and a child or youth with one victimization had a 69% chance of experiencing another during a single year.", "final_summary": "The research question delves into the intricate web of police violence, child victimization, and adverse childhood experiences. The papers assembled offer a comprehensive understanding of these intertwined issues.\n\nFinkelhor (2010) offers a macroscopic view on the trends in children's exposure to violence, abuse, and crime, noting a significant decline in several types of child victimization between 2003 and 2008. However, the study also points out that physical abuse and neglect by caregivers did not see a similar decline, and witnessing the abuse of a sibling even increased. This suggests that while some forms of violence are on the decline, others persist or are even on the rise.\n\nDuke (2010) underscores the impact of multiple types of adverse events on adolescent violence perpetration. The study found that each additional type of adverse event reported by youth increased the risk of violence perpetration by 35% to 144%.\n\nRivera (1990) provides a historical perspective, examining the relationship between childhood victimization and violent offending. The study found that childhood victimization increased the overall risk for violent offending, particularly for males and blacks.\n\nFinkelhor (2009, 2013, 2015) provides a series of national estimates of exposure to violence, crime, and abuse among children and youth. The studies consistently found that a significant proportion of children and youth had experienced at least one direct or witnessed victimization in the previous year.\n\nIn conclusion, the collected papers collectively highlight the pervasive and multifaceted nature of child victimization and adverse childhood experiences.

They are widely distributed in the plant kingdom, where they act as heterologous chemical pheromones that protect plants from external biological insults. Their bioactivities first attracted attention in the 1960s. Documented data demonstrate that cucurbitacins possess strong pharmacological properties, such as antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective effects, etc. Several molecular targets for cucurbitacins have been discovered, such as fibrous-actin, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, cyclooxygenase-2, etc. The present study summarizes the achievements of the 50 years of research on cucurbitacins. The aim was to systematically analyze their bioactivities with an emphasis on their anticancer effects. Research and development has shed new insight into the beneficial properties of these compounds.\n\n==\n\nLavie 1971:\n\nTitle: The cucurbitanes, a group of tetracyclic triterpenes.\n\nAbstract: The potent physiological activity of plants belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family has been known since antiquity. They were feared on account of their high toxicity (Elisha\u2019s Miracle)*, and vet valued because of the medicinal properties ascribed to them (40). Greeks and Romans used them, the doctors of the Middle Ages praised their virtues and some were still described in the British Pharmacopoeia of 1914.\n\n==\n\nChen 2005:\n\nTitle: Cucurbitacins and cucurbitane glycosides: structures and biological activities.\n\nAbstract: The natural cucurbitacins constitute a group of triterpenoid substances which are well-known for their bitterness and toxicity. Structurally, they are characterized by the tetracyclic cucurbitane nucleus skeleton, namely, 19-(10-->9beta)-abeo-10alpha-lanost-5-ene (also known as 9beta-methyl-19-norlanosta-5-ene), with a variety of oxygen substitutions at different positions. According to the characteristics of their structures, cucurbitacins are divided into twelve categories. The biological effects of the cucurbitacins are also covered.\n\n==\n\nWalker 2011:\n\nTitle: The potential of cucurbit[n]urils in drug delivery\n\nAbstract: In this paper we review cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]), a relatively new family of macrocycles that has shown potential in improving drug delivery. Encapsulation of drugs within the homologues CB[6], CB[7], or CB[8] can impart enhanced chemical and physical stability, improve drug solubility, and control drug release. The formulation of CB[n] into a dosage form suitable for clinical use is a non-trivial task, because the free macrocycle and its host-drug complex generally exhibit pseudo-polymorphism in the solid state. Despite this, cucurbiturils have been included in tablets for oral delivery and inserts for nasal delivery. Here we examine the potential use of cucurbiturils in drug delivery in the context of getting a new drug into clinical trials and discuss what further research is needed in this area.\n\n==\n\nR\u00edos 2005:\n\nTitle: New insights into the bioactivity of cucurbitacins\n\nAbstract: The cucurbitacins are a group of tetracyclic triterpenoids derived from the cucurbitane skeleton and found primarily in the Cucurbitaceae family. These triterpenoids, present in free or glycosidic form, are generally responsible for the bitter taste of the plants that contain them and are probably the principal cause of the antifeedant effects observed for such plants. Several plants used in traditional medicine to treat both inflammatory diseases as well as various types of tumors are rich in cucurbitacins, a fact which has given rise to several studies concerning their potential use as anti-inflammatory and anticancer agents. Nevertheless, since many cucurbitacins are extremely toxic, relatively few papers have dealt with their pharmacological activity. Recently, however, the relationship between the toxicity of a compound and its chemical pattern of substitution has been established, thus allowing for a more in-depth understanding of this class of triterpenes. In the present review, we provide a compilation of all the studies published in the last ten years on the pharmacological and biological effects of cucurbitacins, focusing principally on their pharmacological properties, especially their anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects.\n\n==\n\nMetcalf 1980:\n\nTitle: Cucurbitacins as kairomones for diabroticite beetles.\n\nAbstract: The characteristic bitter substances of the Cucurbitaceae act as kairomones for a large group of diabroticite beetles (Chrysomelidae, Galerucinae, Luperini), promoting host selection and compulsive feeding behavior. These beetles (e.g., Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi) respond to as little as 1 ng of cucurbitacin (Cuc) B on thin-layer plates by arrest and compulsive feeding. Six species of diabroticite beetles were about 10 times more responsive to Cuc B than to Cuc E and less responsive to Cuc D, I, and L. Chloroform extracts of 18 species of Cucurbita were developed on thin-layer chromatograms and exposed to diabroticite beetles. The feeding patterns showed pronounced beetle responses to three general Cuc distribution patterns: Cuc B and D as in Cucurbita andreana and C. ecuadorensis; Cuc E and I as in C. okeechobeensis and C. martinezii; and Cuc E glycoside in C. texana. All the diabroticites responded in exactly the same feeding patterns. The results demonstrate a coevolutionary association between the Cucurbitaceae and the Luperini, during which the intensely bitter and toxic Cucs that arose to repel herbivores and protect the plants from attack became specific kairomone feeding stimulants for the beetles.", "final_summary": "Cucurbitacins, a class of highly oxidized tetracyclic triterpenoids, have been the subject of extensive research due to their varied pharmacological activities.

The contention is that, contrary to these claims, flexible labour markets generate fundamental contradictions and unsustainable long-term trends. The jobs miracle is exaggerated and based on low productivity jobs, outsiders often lose most from competition, claimants must work flexibly but still secure a full-time wage, low-wage employment is shrinking the fiscal base, jobs are not being adjusted to accommodate workers' changing needs and capacities and the disposable labour model is undermining long-term productivity.\n\n==\n\nOorschot 2004:\n\nTitle: Flexible work and flexicurity policies in the Netherlands. Trends and experiences\n\nAbstract: Increasing the flexibility of work and working life has been high on the agenda of Dutch public debate for at least 15 years. Resulting policies have been guided by the aspiration of combining flexibility and security, or of achieving adequate \u2018flexicurity\u2019, as the combination of these goals has come to be known. This article describes and analyses Dutch flexicurity policies of recent years, as they have been adopted in the fields of part-time work, social security, labour law and the work-care combination. It shows that the government has made it easier for employers and employees to choose part-time work as a strategy for increasing flexibility. In the field of social security there are numerous problems, especially for \u2018flex\u2019 -workers (not for part-time workers as such), but little substantial improvements have been implemented. In labour law important flexibility and security measures have been adopted, but here government has been rather slow in taking the lead. As regards the work-care combination, new policies have improved conditions, but the Netherlands still lags behind other European countries. L\u2019 augmentation de la flexibilit\u00e9 du travail et de la vie active figure parmi les priorit\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019 ordre du jour des d\u00e9bats publics aux Pays-Bas depuis au moins 15 ans. Les politiques d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es se sont efforc\u00e9es de combiner flexibilit\u00e9 et s\u00e9curit\u00e9, ou de mettre en oeuvre une \u00abflexicurit\u00e9\u00bb ad\u00e9quate, terme choisi pour d\u00e9signer cette combinaison. Cet article d\u00e9crit et analyse les politiques de flexicurit\u00e9 aux Pays-Bas ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es dans le domaine du travail \u00e0 temps partiel, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale, de la l\u00e9gislation du travail et de la conciliation de la vie professionnelle et familiale. Il montre que le gouvernement a permis aux employeurs et aux travailleurs de choisir le travail \u00e0 temps partiel comme strat\u00e9gie pour accro\u00eetre la flexibilit\u00e9. Dans le domaine de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale, il y a de nombreux probl\u00e8mes, particuli\u00e8rement pour les \u00ab flex \u00bb-travailleurs (mais pas pour les travailleurs \u00e0 temps partiel en tant que tels), mais de petites am\u00e9liorations substantielles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en oeuvre.

Seit mindestens 15 Jahren steht die Erh\u00f6hung der Flexibilit\u00e4t der Arbeit und des Arbeitslebens in den Niederlanden im Mittelpunkt der \u00f6ffentlichen Debatte. Die daraus resultierenden Ma\u03b2nahmen wurden von dem Streben geleitet, Flexibilit\u00e4t und Sicherheit miteinander zu verkn\u00fcpfen, oder zu einer angemessenen \u201cFlexicurity\u201d, wie diese Verkn\u00fcpfung der beiden Ziele bezeichnet wird, zu gelangen. Dieser Beitrag beschreibt und analysiert die niederl\u00e4ndischen Ma\u03b2nahmen, die in den letzten Jahren in den Bereichen Teilzeitarbeit, soziale Sicherheit, Arbeitsrecht und Vereinbarkeit von Arbeit und Betreuungspflichten ergriffen wurden, um das Ziel der Flexicurity zu erreichen. Der Beitrag zeigt, dass die Regierung es aus strategischen Gr\u00fcnden Arbeitgebern und Arbeitnehmern leichter macht, sich f\u00fcr Teilzeitarbeit zu entscheiden, um die Flexibilit\u00e4t zu erh\u00f6hen. Im Bereich der sozialen Sicherheit gibt es zahlreiche Probleme, besonders f\u00fcr \u201cFlex\u201c-Arbeitnehmer (nicht f\u00fcr Teilzeitbesch\u00e4ftigte an sich), aber hier wurden nur geringe substanzielle Verbesserungen erzielt. Im Arbeitsrecht wurden zwar bedeutende Ma\u03b2nahmen zur F\u00f6rderung der Flexibilit\u00e4t und der Sicherheit ergriffen, aber die Regierung hat in diesem Bereich nur mit Verz\u00f6gerung die Initiative ergriffen. Was die Vereinbarkeit von Arbeit und Betreuungspflichten angeht, haben sich die Bedingungen zwar aufgrund neuer Ma\u03b2nahmen verbessert, aber die Niederlande bleiben dennoch nach wie vor hinter anderen europ\u00e4ischen L\u00e4ndern zur\u00fcck.\n\n==\n\nBeatson 1994:\n\nTitle: Labour market flexibility\n\nAbstract: The overarching labour market policy of the British government is to aim for a competitive, efficient and flexible labour market.

We analyze the legislative discourse for rationale in support of and opposition to this policy, connect findings to current flexible work research, and identify criteria for evaluating the impact of flextime policies with attention to intersections of gender and socioeconomic status. Unexpectedly, traditional views on hierarchical manager-worker relations figured more prominently than gender in the Congressional debates.\n\n==\n\nHalpern 2005:\n\nTitle: How time\u2010flexible work policies can reduce stress, improve health, and save money\n\nAbstract: Data from the US National Study of the Changing Workforce (a nationally representative sample of working adults) were used to test the hypothesis that employees with time-flexible work policies reported less stress, higher levels of commitment to their employer, and reduced costs to the organization because of fewer absences, fewer days late, and fewer missed deadlines. The model provides persuasive findings for the hypothesized relationship and offers important suggestions to employers who can translate reduced illness into savings and increased commitment into better employees. Contrary to expectations, there were no gender differences in how employees responded to flexible work policies, showing that gender-neutral work policies make financial sense. By showing that time-flexible work policies provide employer benefits, we can hasten the change to a new worker model\u2014one that is family and employer friendly. The business case for family-friendly work policies may prove to be the best tool we have in changing how we live and work.

These are critical issues for employers, trade unions and governments. Recent opinions from the European Court of Justice have raised the political profile of the subject and the European Commission is committed to further action on this issue in 1997. This paper addresses these issues in a comparative European context. The paper presents evidence on developments in flexible working from organisations across Europe. Flexible working here covers only working time and contractual variations (temporary contracts, outsourcing etc.).(3) The paper summarise the debates on the topic; briefly outlines the research that was done; shows the extent and growth of flexibility; explores the reasons for the massive growth in flexible working in Europe and considers whether this is evidence of convergence of European labour markets. This is followed by a wide-ranging examination of the implications of the findings. Theories of Labour Flexibility The concept of \"labour flexibility\" remains, both in theoretical and practical terms, highly problematic. Despite the huge volume of literature devoted to the so-called \"flexibility debate\" (see bibliography in Brewster et al. 1996a), relatively little progress has been made in resolving many of the problems associated with the concept. In the literature, the term \"flexibility\" is applied to a series of quite distinct (if related) theories. There are those which have been labelled \"post-Fordist\": a category which covers a range of variants, but is characterised by the work of Piore and Sabel (1984), Mathews (1989a, 1989b, 1990, 1992), Lash and Urry (1987), Katz (1985), Kern and Schumann (1987), Tolliday and Zeitlin (1986), and Streeck (1987). For these writers, who generally concentrate on manufacturing industry, new technology is the key to a more flexible form of production, more responsive to increasingly rapid changes in the market. Whilst such developments may depend for their success upon a more skilled, motivated, and flexible workforce, the focus of this stream of writing is on production systems rather than employment. A more critical, \"neo-Marxian\" (Clegg 1990) or \"neo-Fordist\" (Wood 1989b, p. 21) group of writers is also concerned with flexible production, though taking a more negative view of its likely effect on individuals and including discussion of the impact on labour markets (Bramble 1988; Bramble/Fieldes 1989, 1992; Harvey 1989, 1991). An alternative conception of flexibility is provided by researchers in the operational management area. There is also an important set of literature labelled by some as \"managerialist\" (Bagguley 1991, p. 164) or \"neomanagerialist\" (Clegg 1990, p. 210) and typified by the work of Atkinson (1984, 1985a, 1985b, 1986, 1987; Atkinson/Gregory 1986; Atkinson/Meager 1986). His work has been subjected to critiques which have attempted to demonstrate the limited utility and lack of theoretical robustness of his work or even, in the early debates, to deny that the labour market had changed substantially, rather than attempting to build upon the insights which it provides or to develop a more comprehensive theoretical framework based on it (see for example: Pollert 1988a, 1988b). Nonetheless, Atkinson's work has been extremely influential. His vision of flexibility has influenced policy debates internationally (OECD 1986a, 1989). These changes and the development of a more flexible labour market have been controversial. They are seen by some to have taken our societies back towards the early years of the industrial revolution, with the creation of a significant underclass of underprivileged and \"vulnerable\" workers. They are seen by others as evidence of an uncaring and irresponsible approach to employees by employers -- sometimes associated with a desire to \"de-unionise\" the workforce. \u2026\n\n==\n\nGolden 2001:\n\nTitle: Flexible Work Schedules\n\nAbstract: More than 27% of the U.S. workforce now reports having an ability to alter their daily starting and ending times of work. Yet, provision of flexibility in the timing of work is not keeping pace with demand. Moreover, there is much disparity in access to schedule flexibility by workers' demographic, work, and job characteristics. Probit estimation finds that the probability that a worker has such flexibility is reduced by being female, non-White, and less educated. The likelihood is increased by being self-employed, in college, married, part-time, in certain occupations and industries, and working 50 or more hours per week. Flexibility is reduced for those working a standard day shift or 40-hour workweek. Workers thus sacrifice either leisure time or income to gain better access to flexibility in the scheduling of work, or they endure the costs of job mobility. Public policy should focus on delivering more flexible schedules to the excluded 73%.\n\n==\n\nBrewster 1997:\n\nTitle: Flexible working in Europe\n\nAbstract: This research paper analyzes and reports upon the current practice of flexible working amongst organizations in Europe: focussing on current developments in the use, by employing organizations, of parttime workers and a range of contractual variations (temporary work; fixed-term contracts etc). The analysis draws heavily, though not exclusively, upon a substantial, independent database of organizational level questionnaire responses covering all sectors of the economy in 14 European countries. We provide evidence that across Europe there is a substantial amount of flexible working and that there has been a continuing increase in its use. It is argued that these developments have considerable, as yet little understood, implications for policy makers, individuals and employers.", "final_summary": "Flexible work policy, a term that encompasses a variety of arrangements allowing employees to alter their working hours or location, has been the subject of extensive research. \n\nRubery (2016) critically examines the notion that flexible labor markets are a panacea for various labor market and societal challenges, arguing that they may generate contradictions and unsustainable long-term trends. Oorschot (2004) discusses the Dutch approach to flexible work, known as 'flexicurity', which aims to balance flexibility and security. However, the author notes that while part-time work has been promoted as a strategy for increasing flexibility, substantial improvements in social security for 'flex' workers have been limited.\n\nBeatson (1994) assesses the British government's overarching labor market policy, which aims for a competitive, efficient, and flexible labor market.

This article develops a coherent theory of organizational attention, drawing on Cornelissen\u0219s domain-interactive metaphor model.

Attention can be defined as an internal cognitive process by which one actively selects environmental information (i.e., sensation) or actively processes information from internal sources (i.e., stored memories and thoughts; Sternberg, 1996). In more general terms, attention can be defined as an ability to focus and maintain interest in a given task or idea, including managing distractions. Attention is selective by its nature. According to Pashler (1998, p. 37), \" The process of selecting from among the many potentially available stimuli is the clearest manifestation of selective attention. \" Why do firms respond to certain events or stimuli in their environment while neglecting others? It seems that organizations, just like individuals , have limited attention capacity. Hence, they must select from among the many potentially available stimuli and respond to these selected stimuli only. Organizational attention is defined as the socially structured pattern of attention by decision makers within the organization (Ocasio, 1997). Organizational attention, like human attention , is a limited resource: \" Attentional limits filter or screen incoming information such that a great deal of data pertinent to strategic decision may never get processed \" (2003) show that the extent to which CEOs (chief executive officers) are selective in their attention to sectors of the environment is a significant predictor of performance. Knowledge management (KM) models and process theories, almost without exception, incorporate a stage or phase in which a given knowledge item is brought to bear on a current decision or action. This stage, referred to alternatively as, is of crucial importance in any knowledge-management cycle. The flow of knowledge in and out of an awareness stage is not merely a function of the universe of available organizational memory or the technological tools available to filter and identify such knowledge. It is influenced to a large degree by organizational attention. The second area in which organizational attention is key is knowledge acquisition and creation as discussed by Ocasio (1997), and Yaniv and Elizur (2003). Successful knowledge management requires attention. Davenport and Volpel (2001) argues that attention is the currency of the information age. Knowledge consumers must pay attention to knowledge and become actively involved in the knowledge-transfer processes. This is particularly important when the knowledge to be received is tacit (Nonaka, 1994).

These range from routine directives to cut through red tape to exceptional demands to alter policy priorities. We theorize that how attention is organized by public bureaucracies affects their responses. We draw on a variety of scholarship about public bureaucracies to develop a theory about the bureaucratic organization of attention and its consequences. In illustrating these notions, we trace federal agency attention to the threat of terrorism as it gained prominence on the national policy agenda over the 1980s to 1990s and became a prominent issue after the terrorist attacks of 2001. The consequences of the Department of Homeland Security's centralized attention to the terrorism threat suggest a paradox of issue attention. Though concentration of authority at the top of the organization holds the prospect of control over the substance and speed of policymaking, this control is highly circumscribed by the limits of attention faced by all organizations.\n\n==\n\nG\u00f3mez 2018:\n\nTitle: Just Paying Attention: Communication for Organizational Attention\n\nAbstract: The main premises in this article are that organizational attention is inherently communicative, and can be nurtured through communication interventions.

A production process can be coordinated ex ante, by letting agents stick to a prespecified plan of action. Alternatively, agents may adapt to task-specific shocks, in which case tasks must be coordinated ex post, using communication. When attention is scarce, an optimal organization coordinates only a few tasks ex post. Those tasks are higher performing, more adaptive to the environment, and influential. Hence, scarce attention requires setting priorities, not just local optimization. Our results provide microfoundations for a central idea in the management literature that firms should focus on a limited set of core competencies.\n\n==\n\nForster 2016:\n\nTitle: Establishing the Attention-Distractibility Trait\n\nAbstract: Failures to focus attention will affect any task engagement (e.g., at work, in the classroom, when driving). At the clinical end, distractibility is a diagnostic criterion of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we examined whether the inability to maintain attentional focus varies in the overall population in the form of an attention-distractibility trait. To test this idea, we administered an ADHD diagnostic tool to a sample of healthy participants and assessed the relationship between ADHD symptoms and task distraction. ADHD symptom summary scores were significantly positively associated with distractor interference in letter-search and name-classification tasks (as measured by reaction time), as long as the distractors were irrelevant (cartoon images) rather than relevant (i.e., compatible or incompatible with target names). Higher perceptual load during a task eliminated distraction irrespective of ADHD score. These findings suggest the existence of an attention-distractibility trait that confers vulnerability to irrelevant distraction, which can be remedied by increasing the level of perceptual load during the task.", "final_summary": "Organizational attention, as explored by Yaniv (2011) and Ferreira (2010), refers to how organizations selectively focus on certain stimuli while ignoring others due to their limited cognitive capacity. This concept is likened to the cognitive process of attention in individuals, where a limited amount of information is selected and processed from a vast array of internal and environmental inputs (Yaniv, 2011).\n\nYaniv (2011) further suggests that organizational attention is a critical factor in managing knowledge within an organization. It plays a significant role in knowledge acquisition, creation, and transfer processes, particularly when dealing with tacit knowledge. May (2007) adds that the way attention is organized within bureaucracies can influence their responses to policy directives, ranging from routine to exceptional demands.\n\nCommunication is also a key aspect of organizational attention.

Hence, the daily information overflow is identified as a pressure variable adversely affecting the attention. This is manifested by an increased likelihood of missing key information when making decisions, diminished time for attentive reflection, difficulty in holding others' attention, as well as by decreased ability to focus when necessary, which are symptoms of the so-called organizational attention deficit disorder - OADD. As to the state variable there were combined techniques from cognitive neuroscience and applied sciences in order to objectively measure the incidence of OADD. In particular, the use of neuropsychological procedures for objective assessment of OADD will be summarized. Namely, few attention diagnostic tests of the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks Program (ANT) will be considered for determining the focused, shifted and sustained attention. As intervention measure attention strengthening techniques is applied. In particular, in re- search were proposed the neurofeedback technique as response variable and have shown its effectiveness in coping with the OADD. This approach repre- sents a new perspective in social psychophysiology and expands the potential applications of ANT and neurofeedback methodology. 1 Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia,\n\n==\n\nOrgan 1997:\n\nTitle: Organizational Citizenship Behavior: It's Construct Clean-Up Time\n\nAbstract: Accumulated empirical evidence, some telling criticisms, and even the most cursory glance at the business press compel us to rethink the defining character of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB).

Amylase are extracellular enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of internal \u03b1-1,4-glycosidic linkages in starch to dextrin, and other small carbohydrate molecules constituted of glucose units. Although enzymes are produced from animal and plant sources, the microbial sources are generally the most suitable for commercial applications. Bacteria from hot springs is widely used as a source of various enzymes, such as amylase. But the amount of amylase-producing bacteria is still very limited. Therefore it is necessary to search sources of amylase-producing bacteria new, such as from hot springs Pariangan.

To ensure robust findings, the authors employ two econometric models of static and dynamic panels, multiple monetary policy indicators and alternative measures of bank leverage and liquidity.FindingsBanks respond to monetary expansion by raising their financial leverage on the liability side and cutting their liquidity positions on the asset side. Further analysis suggests that larger banks' financial leverage is more responsive to monetary policy changes, while smaller banks strengthen the potency of monetary policy transmission toward bank liquidity. Additionally, the authors document that lower interest rates induce a beneficial effect on the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) under Basel III guidelines, implying that banks appear to modify the composition of liabilities to improve the stability of funding sources.Originality/valueThe study is the first attempt to simultaneously examine the impacts of monetary policy on both sides of bank balance sheets, across various banks of different sizes under a multiple-tool monetary regime.

These financial market frictions are embedded in an otherwise-standard dynamic New Keynesian model. We find that exogenous shocks have an amplified and more persistent effect on output and investment, relative to the case of perfect capital markets. The chief contribution of the paper is to analyse how these financial sector imperfections - in particular, those relating to the banking sector - modify our understanding of optimal monetary policy. Our main finding is that optimal monetary policy tolerates only a very small amount of inflation volatility. Given that similar results have been reported for models that abstract from banks, we conclude that assigning a non-trivial role for banks need not materially affect the properties of optimal monetary policy.\n\n==\n\nGambacorta 2018:\n\nTitle: Why Bank Capital Matters for Monetary Policy\n\nAbstract: One aim of post-crisis monetary policy has been to ease credit conditions for borrowers by unlocking bank lending. We find that bank equity is an important determinant of both the bank's funding cost and its lending growth. In a cross-country bank-level study, we find that a 1 percentage point increase in the equity-to-total assets ratio is associated with a 4 basis point reduction in debt financing and with a 0.6 percentage point increase in annual loan growth.\n\n==\n\nMcMillin 1996:\n\nTitle: Monetary policy and bank portfolios\n\nAbstract: Abstract This paper examines the existence of the bank lending channel for monetary policy over the period 1973:1\u20131994:11. The results are consistent with a bank lending channel when the Bernanke-Blinder model is extended to include commercial paper and the spread between the loan and commercial paper rates. The results are robust to alternative monetary policy measures. However, stability tests indicate instability over the nonborrowed reserves operating regime. When the estimates excluded data for this period, there was little evidence of systematic movement in bank loans in the direction predicted by the bank lending channel.\n\n==\n\nHeuvel 2006:\n\nTitle: The Bank Capital Channel of Monetary Policy\n\nAbstract: This paper examines the role of bank lending in the transmission of monetary policy in the presence of capital adequacy regulations. I develop a dynamic model of bank asset and liability management that incorporates risk-based capital requirements and an imperfect market for bank equity. These conditions imply a failure of the Modigliani-Miller theorem for the bank: its lending will depend on the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial structure, as well as on lending opportunities and market interest rates. Combined with a maturity mismatch on the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet, this gives rise to a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbank capital channel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by which monetary policy affects bank lending through its impact on bank equity capital. This mechanism does not rely on any particular role of bank reserves and thus falls outside the conventional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbank lending channel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. I analyze the dynamics of the new channel. An important result is that monetary policy effects on bank lending depend on the capital adequacy of the banking sector; lending by banks with low capital has a delayed and then amplified reaction to interest rate shocks, relative to well-capitalized banks. Other implications are that bank capital affects lending even when the regulatory constraint is not momentarily binding, and that shocks to bank profits, such as loan defaults, can have a persistent impact on lending\n\n==\n\nBernanke 2000:\n\nTitle: Monetary Policy and Asset Price Volatility\n\nAbstract: We explore the implications of asset price volatility for the management of monetary policy. We show that it is desirable for central banks to focus on underlying inflationary pressures. Asset prices become relevant only to the extent they may signal potential inflationary or deflationary forces. Rules that directly target asset prices appear to have undesirable side effects. We base our conclusions on (i) simulation of different policy rules in a small scale macro model and (ii) a comparative analysis of recent U.S. and Japanese monetary policy.\n\n==\n\nBianchi 2014:\n\nTitle: Banks, Liquidity Management and Monetary Policy\n\nAbstract: We develop a new framework for studying the implementation of monetary policy through the banking sector. Banks are subject to a maturity mismatch problem leading to precautionary holdings of reserves. Through various instruments, monetary policy alters tradeos banks face between lending, holding reserves, holding deposits and paying dividends. This translates into the real economy via eects on real interests and lending. We study how these instruments interact with shocks to the volatility in the payments system, bank losses, the demand for loans and with capital requirements. We use a calibrated version of the model to answer, quantitatively, why have banks held onto a substantial increase in reserves while not increasing lending since 2008.\n\n==\n\nC\u00fardia 2010:\n\nTitle: The Central-Bank Balance Sheet as an Instrument of Monetary Policy\n\nAbstract: While many analyses of monetary policy consider only the adjustment of a central bank\u2019s target for a short-term nominal interest rate, other dimensions of policy have recently been of greater importance: changes in the supply of bank reserves beyond those required to achieve an interest-rate target, changes in the assets acquired by central banks, and changes in the interest rate paid on reserves. We extend a standard New Keynesian model to allow a role for the central bank\u2019s balance sheet in equilibrium determination, and consider the connections between these alternative dimensions of policy and traditional interest-rate policy. We distinguish between \\quantitative easing\" in the strict sense and targeted asset purchases by a central bank, and argue that while the former is likely be inefiective at all times, the latter dimension of policy can be efiective when flnancial markets are su\u2010ciently disrupted. Neither is a perfect substitute for conventional interest-rate policy, but purchases of illiquid assets are particularly likely to improve welfare when the zero lower bound on the policy rate is reached. We also consider optimal policy with regard to the payment of interest on reserves, and argue that the interest rate on reserves should be kept near the central bank\u2019s target for the policy rate at all times.", "final_summary": "Monetary policy plays a significant role in shaping bank assets and their financial structure.

Aikman (2006) found that financial sector imperfections, particularly those related to the banking sector, amplify and prolong the effects of exogenous shocks on output and investment.

Our approach starts building topological maps from independent image sequences where natural landmarks extracted from conventional images are grouped to create a graph of planes. With this approach the features observed in several images belonging to the same planar region are stored only once, reducing the size of the individual maps. In a distributed scenario this is very important because smaller maps can be transmitted faster, which makes our approach better suited for cooperative mapping. The later fusion of the individual maps is obtained via distributed consensus without any initial information about the relations between the different maps. Experiments with real images in complex scenarios show the good performance of our proposal.\n\n==\n\nLiu 2014:\n\nTitle: Topological Mapping and Scene Recognition With Lightweight Color Descriptors for an Omnidirectional Camera\n\nAbstract: Scene recognition problems for mobile robots have been extensively studied.

In this paper, we describe a lightweight novel scene recognition method using an adaptive descriptor, which is based on color features and geometric information that are extracted from an uncalibrated omnidirectional camera. The proposed method enables a mobile robot to perform online registration of new scenes onto a topological representation automatically and solve the localization problem to topological regions simultaneously, all in real time. We adopt a Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) to describe the online inference process. It is based on an approximation of conditional probabilities of the new measurements given incrementally estimated reference models. It enables online inference speeds of up to 50 Hz for a normal CPU. We compare it with state-of-the-art key-point descriptors and show the advantage of the proposed algorithm in terms of performance and computational efficiency. A real-world experiment is carried out with a mobile robot equipped with an omnidirectional camera.

In particular, we focus on an unsupervised construction of topological maps, which provide an abstraction of the environment in terms of visual aspects. An unsupervised clustering algorithm is used to represent the images in multiple subspaces, forming thus a sensory grounded representation of the environment's appearance. By introducing transitional fields between clusters we are able to obtain a partitioning of the image set into distinctive visual aspects. By abstracting the low-level sensory data we are able to efficiently reconstruct the overall topological layout of the covered path. After the high level topology is estimated, we repeat the procedure on the level of visual aspects to obtain local topological maps. We demonstrate how the resulting representation can be used for modeling indoor and outdoor environments, how it successfully detects previously visited locations and how it can be used for the estimation of the current visual aspect and the retrieval of the relative position within the current visual aspect.\n\n==\n\nBertrand 2000:\n\nTitle: Topological Encoding of 3D Segmented Images\n\nAbstract: In this paper we define the 3d topological map and give an optimal algorithm which computes it from a segmented image.

IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused untold damage globally, presenting unusual demands on but also unique opportunities for vaccine development. The development, production, and distribution of vaccines are imperative to saving lives, preventing severe illness, and reducing the economic and social burdens caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although vaccine technologies that provide the DNA or RNA sequence of an antigen had never previously been approved for use in humans, they have played a major role in the management of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the history of these vaccines and how they have been applied to SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, given that the evolution of new SARS-CoV-2 variants continues to present a significant challenge in 2022, these vaccines remain an important and evolving tool in the biomedical response to the pandemic.\n\n==\n\nVogel 1995:\n\nTitle: Nucleic acid vaccines\n\nAbstract: The use of nucleic acid-based vaccines is a novel approach to immunization that elicits immune responses similar to those induced by live, attenuated vaccines. Administration of nucleic acid vaccines results in the endogenous generation of viral proteins with native conformation, glycosylation profiles, and other posttranslational modifications that mimic antigen produced during natural viral infection. Nucleic acid vaccines have been shown to elicit both antibody and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses to diverse protein antigens. Advantages of nucleic acid-based vaccines include the simplicity of the vector, the ease of delivery, the duration of expression, and, to date, the lack of evidence of integration. Further studies are needed to assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of this new and promising technology.\n\n==\n\nHoffman 1995:\n\nTitle: Nucleic Acid Malaria Vaccines\n\nAbstract: During the twentieth century, the primary approach to malaria prevention has been to interfere with transmission of the parasite between the infected mosquito and the human host using physical barriers, insecticides and prophylactic drugs. Despite these measures, it is estimated that there are 300-500 new Plasmodium infections and 1-2 million deaths annually due to malaria. Thus, there have been major efforts to develop malaria vaccines. This is thought to be a feasible approach because immunization with radiation-attenuated Plasmodium spp. sporozoites induces sterile protective immunity against malaria in rodents, primates and humans(reviewed in Ref. 2). The complex life cycle of the Plasmodium spp. parasites and the extensive variability among strains of the same Plasmodium species dictate, however, that an effective malaria vaccine will probably need to induce protective antibodies as well as effector CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes specific for variants of multiple antigens expressed at different stages of the life cycle. It is our view that nucleic acid vaccines offer an excellent approach to developing a multivalent vaccine that effectively activates all arms of the immune system. Furthermore, such vaccines may overcome the additional problem inherent in subunit vaccine development: major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction of the protective immune responses to identified target epitopes. Supporting data and rationale for our view are presented here. The major emphasis of the work thus far has been to use plasmid DNA to induce protective CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), but the induction of protective antibody and CD4+ T cell responses is being investigated.\n\n==\n\nHasan 1999:\n\nTitle: Nucleic acid immunization: concepts and techniques associated with third generation vaccines.\n\nAbstract: A radical change in vaccine methodology arrived nine years ago with the advent of nucleic acid immunization.

Vaccination is the most effective method to protect against infectious diseases. The objective is to ensure that everyone has access to a COVID-19 vaccine. The conventional vaccine development platforms are complex and time-consuming to obtain desired approved vaccine candidates through rigorous regulatory pathways. These safeguards guarantee that the optimized vaccine product is safe and efficacious for various demographic populations prior to it being approved for general use. Nucleic acid vaccines employ genetic material from a pathogen, such as a virus or bacteria, to induce an immune response against it. Based on the vaccination, the genetic material might be DNA or RNA; as such, it offers instructions for producing a specific pathogen protein that the immune system will perceive as foreign and mount an immune response. Nucleic acid vaccines for multiple antigens might be made in the same facility, lowering costs even more. Most traditional vaccine regimens do not allow for this. Herein, we demonstrate the recent understanding and advances in nucleic acid vaccines (DNA and mRNA based) against COVID-19, specifically those in human clinical trials.\n\n==\n\nBabiuk 2000:\n\nTitle: Nucleic acid vaccines: research tool or commercial reality.\n\nAbstract: Polynucleotide immunization has captured the imagination of numerous researchers and commercial companies around the world as a novel approach for inducing immunity in animals.

Firms that face high environmental uncertainty are increasingly facing higher risks in terms of supply disruptions, production and delivery delays that ultimately result in poor operational performance. This study aims at understanding the antecedents of supply chain operational risk faced by firms and the conditions under which such risks can be mitigated. Using Indian data from the sixth edition of International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS) and structural equation modeling, we investigate the relationships between environmental uncertainty and supply chain risk and the moderating effect of supply chain flexibility. We identify appropriate types of flexibility to mitigate the three major aspects of supply chain risk: supply risk, manufacturing process risk and delivery risk. Our empirical investigation reveals that uncertainty in the supply chain leads to high supply chain risk; and in uncertain environments, supply and manufacturing flexibility help in reducing the supply and manufacturing process risks respectively. However, our results also indicate that, in emerging markets such as India where logistic infrastructure is less developed, internal capabilities alone may not be sufficient in reducing supply chain delivery risk. Our findings not only contribute towards filling certain gaps in the supply chain risk management literature, but also provide practicing managers and researchers a better understanding of the types of flexibility that can mitigate supply chain risk in different business environments.\n\n==\n\nFord 2015:\n\nTitle: Supply Chain Quality Management and Environmental Uncertainty: A Contingency Perspective\n\nAbstract: This article extends contingency perspectives of quality management to the interorganizational quality context. Supply chain quality management (SCQM) is conceptualized as a mechanism for governing quality of resource flows between interdependent organizations. Higher environmental uncertainty is proposed to intensify SCQM practices among supply chain members. However, SCQM practices are likely to assume different orientations depending on whether volume or technological uncertainty is present. High asset specificities among exchange partners are proposed to moderate the relationship between SCQM and environmental uncertainty by elevating quality practice intensities as environments become more turbulent. Disequilibrium environments should discourage SCQM, as organizations lack bureaucratic resources to manage the quality of interorganizational resource flows via bureaucratic means. Implications of these propositions on research and practice are discussed.\n\n==\n\nSingh 2020:\n\nTitle: Managing environmental uncertainty for improved firm financial performance: the moderating role of supply chain risk management practices on managerial decision making\n\nAbstract: ABSTRACT With increasing global exposure, organisations have started to witness supply chain risks that they traditionally were not exposed to. This article therefore attempts to answer the research question of how environmental uncertainty within a firm\u2019s supply chain, impacts firm financial performance. We further evaluate the role of supply chain risk management practices in mitigating the negative impact of such disruption events. To answer the research question, we conduct a literature review and develop the corresponding hypothesis. We test our hypothesis using both primary and secondary data. The results show that environmental uncertainty has a negative impact on firm financial performance, with entrepreneurial managerial capitalism mediating the impact. However, organisations that adopt macro and network supply chain risk management practices are able to improve managerial decision making frame, and mitigate the negative impact of environmental uncertainty on firm financial performance. The article concludes with our findings, along with managerial and practitioner implications of the research.\n\n==\n\nBoon-itt 2008:\n\nTitle: Moderating Effects of Environmental Uncertainty on Supply Chain Integration and Product Quality: An Empirical Study of Thai Automotive Industry\n\nAbstract: Although effective and efficient supply chain management requires integrated business processes that go beyond purchasing and logistics activities, some doubts are expressed concerning the applicability of supply chain integration practices. Specifically, a careful literature search reveals that no studies have included the effect of environmental uncertainty on the relationship between sup- ply chain integration and product quality. This study, therefore, represents an attempt to provide the contribution in the field by developing a model to explore the relationships and to fulfill the gap between the literature on supply chain integration and environmental uncertainty. The findings indi- cate that the effects of supply chain integration on product quality are moderated by environmental uncertainty as demonstrated by Chow tests. The results also provide managerial insights about envi- ronmental uncertainty-supply chain integration practices connection.\n\n==\n\nGanbold 2017:\n\nTitle: IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL UNCERTAINTY ON SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATION\n\nAbstract: Today\u2019s ever-changing business environment is often described to be highly competitive, dynamic and complex. Customers are demanding more variability, better quality, higher reliability and faster delivery. Organizations are being faced with more uncertainties from its task environment than before. In order to respond to the uncertainties, organizations are internalizing fewer resources and capabilities, while increasing their integration with partners in the supply chain. Drawing on the resource-dependence theory, this study aims to examine the impact of environmental uncertainty on supply chain integration initiatives. Environmental uncertainty is considered in terms of three types, namely, supply uncertainty, demand or customer uncertainty, and technology uncertainty, based on its sources. Supply chain integration is comprised of internal integration, customer integration, and supplier integration. Based on the empirical study with 108 Japanese manufacturing firms, this study makes significant contributions to the knowledge base and provides theoretical and practical implications.\n\n==\n\nInman 2021:\n\nTitle: Environmental uncertainty and supply chain performance: the effect of agility\n\nAbstract: PurposeToday's businesses are facing a world that is more complex, turbulent and unpredictable than in the past with increasing levels of environmental complexity. Rather than proposing environmental uncertainty as a mediator/moderator of the relationship between agility and performance as others have done, the authors offer an alternative view where supply chain agility is seen as mediating the relationship between environmental uncertainty and supply chain performance.Design/methodology/approachThe authors propose that supply chain agility is a response to the effects of environmental uncertainty and, as such, environmental uncertainty should be seen as a driver of supply chain agility. Few studies test the direct relationship between uncertainty and supply chain performance, and none simultaneously test for agility's mediation and moderation effect between environmental uncertainty and agility.FindingsThe model was statistically assessed using partial-least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS/SEM) by analyzing survey data from manufacturing managers in 136 US firms. The study results did not indicate a significant relationship between environmental uncertainty and supply chain performance. However, the authors did find a significant positive relationship between agile manufacturing and supply chain performance using measures that were primarily operations-centered rather than financial. Additionally, the authors found that agile manufacturing fully mediates the relationship between environmental uncertainty and supply chain performance.Originality/valueThe authors\u2019 model, though simple, provides a base for future research for them and other researchers who can incorporate other impacting variables into the model. The study results show that uncertainty can be a force for good and that utilizing agile manufacturing can be a new source of opportunity.\n\n==\n\nXu 2010:\n\nTitle: The effect of environmental uncertainty on supply chain integration in Chinese manufacturing industry\n\nAbstract: Supply chain integration nowadays is considered as an important approach to building and sustaining advantages. Many previous empirical researches focus on the effect of supply chain integration on the firms' performance, yet, the antecedence of supply chain integration is still largely unknown. This paper investigates the relationship between environmental uncertainty (including demand uncertainty, supply uncertainty and technology uncertainty) and supply chain integration (including customer integration, supplier integration and internal integration) with 139 samples from Chinese manufacturing industry. The results reveal both supply uncertainty and technology uncertainty significantly influence supply chain integration; the effect of supply uncertainty is negative, while that of technology uncertainty is positive. However, demand uncertainty just has a significant effect on internal integration. The relationship between demand uncertainty and external integration (including customer integration and supplier integration) is mediated by the internal integration.", "final_summary": "The relationship between environmental uncertainty, demand risk, and supply chain disruption impact is a complex interplay that has been explored in various studies. \n\nFynes (2004) found mixed support for the moderating role of both demand and supply uncertainty in the relationship between environmental uncertainty and supply chain performance.

The ability to distinguish between these different cancers makes possible more accurate prognoses and more finely targeted therapeutics. Making full use of this knowledge, however, requires characterizing commonly occurring cancer sub-types and the specific molecular abnormalities that produce them. Computational approaches to this problem to date have been hindered by the fact that tumors are highly heterogeneous masses typically containing cells at multiple stages of progression from healthy to aggressively malignant. We present a computational approach for taking advantage of tumor heterogeneity when characterizing tumor progression pathways by inferring those pathways from single-cell assays. Our approach uses phylogenetic algorithms to infer likely evolutionary sequences producing cell populations in single tumors, which are in turn used to create a profile of commonly used pathways across the patient population. This approach is combined with expectation maximization to infer unknown parameters used in the phylogeny construction. We demonstrate the approach on a set of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) data measuring cell-by-cell gene and chromosome copy numbers in a large sample of breast cancers. The results validate the proposed computational methods by showing consistency with several previous findings on these cancers.

The aneuploid cells that overexpressed large amounts of both HER-2/neu and ras survived intensive chemotherapy and were responsible for tumor relapse. At relapse, these cells were shown to overexpress simultaneously at least five oncogenes: HER-2/neu, ras, EGF receptor, p53 and c-myc. A partial reconstruction of the genetic evolutionary sequence in this tumor indicated that HER-2/neu overexpression was an early step in the sequence. Subsequent HER-2/neu overexpression, EGF receptor overexpression and p53 protein overexpression were each associated with ras overexpression. The data suggest that ploidy and oncogene overexpression cannot be used as independent clinical prognostic factors. The ability to characterize tumors according to the degree of advancement in the genetic evolutionary might serve as a basis for genetic staging for adjuvant therapy.\n\n==\n\nMeaburn 2009:\n\nTitle: Disease-specific gene repositioning in breast cancer\n\nAbstract: The nuclear repositioning of specific genes may be a novel diagnostic strategy to distinguish malignant from normal tissue.\n\n==\n\nTan 2015:\n\nTitle: Genomic landscapes of breast fibroepithelial tumors\n\nAbstract: Breast fibroepithelial tumors comprise a heterogeneous spectrum of pathological entities, from benign fibroadenomas to malignant phyllodes tumors. Although MED12 mutations have been frequently found in fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors, the landscapes of genetic alterations across the fibroepithelial tumor spectrum remain unclear. Here, by performing exome sequencing of 22 phyllodes tumors followed by targeted sequencing of 100 breast fibroepithelial tumors, we observed three distinct somatic mutation patterns. First, we frequently observed MED12 and RARA mutations in both fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors, emphasizing the importance of these mutations in fibroepithelial tumorigenesis. Second, phyllodes tumors exhibited mutations in FLNA, SETD2 and KMT2D, suggesting a role in driving phyllodes tumor development. Third, borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors harbored additional mutations in cancer-associated genes. RARA mutations exhibited clustering in the portion of the gene encoding the ligand-binding domain, functionally suppressed RARA-mediated transcriptional activation and enhanced RARA interactions with transcriptional co-repressors. This study provides insights into the molecular pathogenesis of breast fibroepithelial tumors, with potential clinical implications.\n\n==\n\nDing 2010:\n\nTitle: Genome Remodeling in a Basal-like Breast Cancer Metastasis and Xenograft\n\nAbstract: Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies provide an unprecedented ability to screen entire genomes for genetic changes associated with tumour progression. Here we describe the genomic analyses of four DNA samples from an African-American patient with basal-like breast cancer: peripheral blood, the primary tumour, a brain metastasis and a xenograft derived from the primary tumour. The metastasis contained two de novo mutations and a large deletion not present in the primary tumour, and was significantly enriched for 20 shared mutations. The xenograft retained all primary tumour mutations and displayed a mutation enrichment pattern that resembled the metastasis. Two overlapping large deletions, encompassing CTNNA1, were present in all three tumour samples. The differential mutation frequencies and structural variation patterns in metastasis and xenograft compared with the primary tumour indicate that secondary tumours may arise from a minority of cells within the primary tumour.\n\n==\n\nPrat 2011:\n\nTitle: Deconstructing the molecular portraits of breast cancer\n\nAbstract: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease in terms of histology, therapeutic response, dissemination patterns to distant sites, and patient outcomes. Global gene expression analyses using high\u2010throughput technologies have helped to explain much of this heterogeneity and provided important new classifications of cancer patients. In the last decade, genomic studies have established five breast cancer intrinsic subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2\u2010enriched, Claudin\u2010low, Basal\u2010like) and a Normal Breast\u2010like group. In this review, we dissect the most recent data on this genomic classification of breast cancer with a special focus on the Claudin\u2010low subtype, which appears enriched for mesenchymal and stem cell features. In addition, we discuss how the combination of standard clinical\u2010pathological markers with the information provided by these genomic entities might help further understand the biological complexity of this disease, increase the efficacy of current and novel therapies, and ultimately improve outcomes for breast cancer patients.\n\n==\n\nRobinson 2011:\n\nTitle: Functionally Recurrent Rearrangements of the MAST Kinase and Notch Gene Families in Breast Cancer\n\nAbstract: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that has a wide range of molecular aberrations and clinical outcomes. Here we used paired-end transcriptome sequencing to explore the landscape of gene fusions in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and tissues. We observed that individual breast cancers have a variety of expressed gene fusions. We identified two classes of recurrent gene rearrangements involving genes encoding microtubule-associated serine-threonine kinase (MAST) and members of the Notch family. Both MAST and Notch-family gene fusions have substantial phenotypic effects in breast epithelial cells. Breast cancer cell lines harboring Notch gene rearrangements are uniquely sensitive to inhibition of Notch signaling, and overexpression of MAST1 or MAST2 gene fusions has a proliferative effect both in vitro and in vivo. These findings show that recurrent gene rearrangements have key roles in subsets of carcinomas and suggest that transcriptome sequencing could identify individuals with rare, targetable gene fusions.", "final_summary": "The reconstruction of phylogeny in breast cancer is a complex and multifaceted topic, as evidenced by the diverse findings in the papers reviewed. \n\nPennington (2006, 2007) developed a computational approach to infer tumor progression pathways from single-cell assays, which takes advantage of tumor heterogeneity.

Urban agglomerations can be seen as complex innovation systems where human activities are shaped in order to transform societies towards sustainable development. For this paper, we focus on the case of an environmental innovation regarding transport policy, the implementation of the fare-free policy on public transport for all inhabitants of Tallinn, Estonia. Tallinn, with 414,000 inhabitants in 2015, is the capital of Estonia and the largest city in the country. Over the last two decades the share of public transport trips decreased dramatically. After a public opinion poll in 2012, in which over 75% of the participants voted for a fare-free public transportation system (FFPTS) in Tallinn, the new policy was implemented on 1st January 2013. From that date on inhabitants of Tallinn could use all public transport services (busses, trams, trolly-busses) operated by city-run operators for free. Later the fare-free system was implemented also on trains within Tallinn. In this paper we analyze the context, in which this policy was implemented, the main characteristics of its implementation and its actual situation.

This article describes a fare-free public transport program in Tallinn, Estonia, launched in 2013, which has exhibited lower-than-expected increases in ridership. Evaluations of Tallinn\u2019s fare-free public transport program are presented and synthesized, with a focus on program goals and how goals are met through program performance. Findings suggest certain flaws limit the program\u2019s potential success since the program design is misaligned with its primary stated goals, and several program goals relating to external effects of fare reform cannot be evaluated. Although it would be valuable for transport managers in other cities to learn about this experience, the Tallinn fare-free public transport program provides scant transferable evidence about how such a program can operate outside of a politicized context, which was crucial to its implementation in Estonia.\n\n==\n\nGaley 2014:\n\nTitle: License to Ride: Free Public Transportation for Residents of Tallinn\n\nAbstract: The City of Tallinn, capital of Estonia, with a population of 420,000, recently became the world\u2019s largest municipality offering free public transportation.

Through a series of interviews with relevant informants, we identify the main enablers and the FFPTS in Tallinn faced and the potential of such a system to contribute to the sustainable city development. Our analysis shows that the interlinking between local and national politics determines not only the type of initiatives implemented and the support they receive but also the degree of their success and their stability. We conclude that to be even more effective, it should be extended to the all potential users, not just to local registered residents as it has been recently applied in state-run bus travels in rural municipalities in Estonia. Finally, more restrictive private car policies should be considered to fuel a sustainable mobility transition and increase cities life quality.\n\n==\n\nK\u0119b\u0142owski 2019:\n\nTitle: Towards an urban political geography of transport: Unpacking the political and scalar dynamics of fare-free public transport in Tallinn, Estonia\n\nAbstract: In this article, we study the largest existing fare-free public transport (FFPT) programme, launched in 2013 in Tallinn, Estonia. Instead of focusing solely on the rationale and impact of fare-free public transport in terms of finances and travel patterns, we propose to analyse FFPT from the perspective of urban political geography, and to inquire into its political and scalar dynamics. We analyse how Tallinn\u2019s fare-free programme was developed, and demonstrate the politics of its conception and implementation. We observe who has access to free travel and we reveal how FFPT is embedded in Estonia\u2019s place-of-residence-based taxation system. Finally, we identify where lies the impact of territorial competition exacerbated by FFPT. Therefore, we argue that transport policies \u2013 of which FFPT is but an example \u2013 should be understood as much more than strategies dealing with transport issues per se. Instead, we propose to approach them as political and spatial projects, whose processual, cross-sectorial and scalar dimensions help to reveal the embeddedness of transport in inherently urban questions of metropolitan governance, electoral strategies, territorial competition and socio-spatial inequalities.\n\n==\n\nCats 2014:\n\nTitle: Public Transport Pricing Policy\n\nAbstract: Cities worldwide are looking for new policies to attract travelers to shift from cars to public transport. Policies focused on reducing public transport fares are aimed at improving social inclusion and leading to a modal shift. The City of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, has recently introduced a fare-free public transport (FFPT) service in an effort to improve accessibility and mobility for its residents. The case of Tallinn is a full-scale, real-world experiment that provides a unique opportunity for investigating the impacts of FFPT policy. A macrolevel empirical evaluation of FFPT impacts on service performance, passenger demand, and accessibility for various groups of travelers is presented. In contrast to previous studies, the influence of FFPT on passenger demand was estimated while changes in supply were controlled. The results indicate that the FFPT measure accounts for an increase of 1.2% in passenger demand, with the remaining increase attributed to an extended network of public transport priority lanes and increased service frequency. The relatively small effect could be attributed to the previous price level and public transport share as well as analysis of the short-term impact. The evidence-based policy evaluation in this paper is instrumental in supporting policy making and facilitating the design of public transport pricing strategies.\n\n==\n\nCats 2017:\n\nTitle: The prospects of fare-free public transport: evidence from Tallinn\n\nAbstract: The subsidy level of public transport systems varies considerably among systems worldwide. While limited-scale free-fare public transport (FFPT) services such as limited campaigns and fare evasion for special groups or specific services are prevalent, there is only limited evidence on the consequences of introducing a full-fledged FFPT. The case of Tallinn, Estonia offers a full-scale experiment that provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impacts of FFPT. This study examines travel pattern changes based on individual travel habit survey shortly before and almost 1\u00a0year after the introduction of FFPT policy in Tallinn based on interviews and travel diaries of a random sample of 1500 household. We analyse modal shift effects and whether they are driven by trip generation or trip substitution, travel attitudes and satisfactions as well as impacts on equity, employment prospects, and trip destination choices. Almost a year after the introduction of FFPT, public transport usage increased by 14\u00a0% and there is evidence that the mobility of low-income residents has improved. The effect of FFPT on ridership is substantially lower than those reported in previous studies due to the good level of service provision, high public transport usage and low public transport fees that existed already prior to the FFPT.\n\n==\n\nCats 2017:\n\nTitle: Erratum to: The prospects of fare-free public transport: evidence from Tallinn\n\nAbstract: The prospects of fare-free public transport : evidence from Tallinn (vol 44, pg 1083, 2017)", "final_summary": "Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, made a groundbreaking move in 2013 by introducing free public transport for its residents, becoming a pioneer in this field (Gabald\u00f3n-Estevan 2016; Galey 2014).

While Gabald\u00f3n-Estevan (2016) and Galey (2014) highlight the positive impact of the policy, Hess (2017) suggests that the increase in ridership was lower than expected.

Equations are treated as abstract stochastic evolution equations for elliptic partial differential operators in an appropriate functional Sobolev space. Explicit forms of solutions are obtained by using a strongly continuous semigroup. The deterministic and the stochastic problem can then be treated under the same theoretical framework. Use of the theory is indicated in an application to the solution of the stochastic analogue of the regional groundwater flow problem studied in Part I. Two cases are solved: The randomly forced and the randomly initiated equation.

We show that the solution of a stochastic advection\u2013diffusion partial differential equation provides a flexible model class for spatiotemporal processes which is computationally feasible also for large data sets. The Gaussian process defined through the stochastic partial differential equation has, in general, a non\u2010separable covariance structure. Its parameters can be physically interpreted as explicitly modelling phenomena such as transport and diffusion that occur in many natural processes in diverse fields ranging from environmental sciences to ecology. To obtain computationally efficient statistical algorithms, we use spectral methods to solve the stochastic partial differential equation. This has the advantage that approximation errors do not accumulate over time, and that in the spectral space the computational cost grows linearly with the dimension, the total computational cost of Bayesian or frequentist inference being dominated by the fast Fourier transform. The model proposed is applied to post\u2010processing of precipitation forecasts from a numerical weather prediction model for northern Switzerland. In contrast with the raw forecasts from the numerical model, the post\u2010processed forecasts are calibrated and quantify prediction uncertainty. Moreover, they outperform the raw forecasts, in the sense that they have a lower mean absolute error.\n\n==\n\nLamnabhi-Lagarrigue 1983:\n\nTitle: Algebraic computation of the statistics of the solution of some nonlinear stochastic differential equations\n\nAbstract: This paper presents an algebraic method for computing the statistics of the solution of some stochastic non-linear differential equations by mean of the Volterra functional expansion.

Thus, the challenge for climate policy is to encourage the transfer of these climate-friendly technologies to the developing world. This policy brief reviews the economic literature on environmental technology transfer. It then discusses the implications of this literature for climate policy, focuing on the Clean Developmenht Mechanism (CDM) ofthe Kyoto Protocol.

The key challenge is that low-carbon sustainable technologies need to be adopted both by developed as well as developing countries, in an effort to avoid past unsustainable practices and being locked into old, less sustainable technologies. Technology transfer (TT), as an important feature of both the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol can play a key role. TT can allow countries to move quickly to environmentally sound and sustainable practices, institutions and technologies. Indeed, the transfer or innovation process must be fast enough, to reduce global vulnerability to climate change. The aim of this paper is to analyse the TT challenges and emerging opportunities under the new climate regime, in terms of the process of innovation into an existing energy system, the related barriers and the supporting diffusion mechanisms.

Reducing these emissions while still enabling developing countries to grow requires the use of climate-friendly technologies in these countries. In most cases, these technologies are first created in high-income countries. Thus, the challenge for climate policy is to encourage the transfer of these climate-friendly technologies to the developing world. This article reviews the economic literature on environmental technology transfer and discusses the implications of this literature for climate policy, focusing on the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). A key point is that technology diffusion is gradual. Early adoption of policy by developed countries leads to the development of new technologies that make it easier for developing countries to reduce pollution as well. Since clean technologies are first developed in the world's leading economies, international trade and foreign investments provide access to these technologies. Moreover, evidence suggests that some technologies, such as those enhancing energy efficiency, will diffuse to developing countries even without the aid of policy prescriptions, such as the CDM. This is important for assessing the potential emissions reductions of proposed CDM projects.\n\n==\n\nUeno 2009:\n\nTitle: Technology Transfer to China to Address Climate Change Mitigation\n\nAbstract: This paper analyzes whether and how transfer of climate mitigation technologies to China occurs, by studying cases of seven technologies that are at the stage of deployment or diffusion.

International division of labor of manufacturing and localization policies by the Chinese government facilitated local production by China, which resulted in deep cuts in production costs. Such cost reduction, coupled with technology diffusion policies by the Chinese government, then accelerated deployment and diffusion in China and other emerging economies that import Chinese products.\n\n==\n\nPigato 2020:\n\nTitle: Technology Transfer and Innovation for Low-Carbon Development\n\nAbstract: Technological revolutions have increased the world\u2019s wealth to a level that was once unimaginable.

Technology Transfer and Innovation for Low-Carbon Development argues that most of the emissions reductions required to achieve the Paris Agreement goals can be reached through the global deployment of existing and commercially proven low-carbon technologies (LCTs). Deploying LCTs from high-income countries, which account for 80 percent of all LCT innovations and 70 percent of all LCT exports, to developing countries, where they are needed most, will not be easy; but the evidence is clear that it can be done. Transferring LCTs is not only necessary to meet the climate targets, but it is also an opportunity to achieve development goals. The policies needed to deploy LCTs to developing countries could raise output and employment while yielding welfare benefits, such as reduced air and water pollution. Moreover, adopting LCT offers an opportunity for countries to benefit from participation in global value chains and to become LCT producers and exporters.", "final_summary": "The body of research highlights the importance of technology transfer in promoting climate adaptation and mitigation, particularly from developed to developing countries (Flamos, 2010; Popp, 2010; Karakosta, 2010; Tawney, 2011; Lee, 2021; Popp, 2011; Ueno, 2009; Pigato, 2020). \n\nFlamos (2010) and Karakosta (2010) discuss the necessity for both developed and developing countries to adopt low-carbon sustainable technologies to reduce global vulnerability to climate change.

Two components of this ratio can, however, carry different signals for a potential mate. Hip size indicates pelvic size and the amount of additional fat storage that can be used as a source of energy. Waist size conveys information such as current reproductive status or health status. To assess which of these two dimensions is more important for men's perception of female attractiveness, we used a series of photographs of a woman with WHR manipulated either by hip or waist changes. Attractiveness was correlated negatively with WHR, when WHR was manipulated by waist size. The relation was inverted-U shape when WHR was changed by hip size. We postulate that in westernized societies with no risk of seasonal lack of food, the waist, conveying information about fecundity and health status, will be more important than hip size for assessing a female's attractiveness.\n\n==\n\nLittle 2001:\n\nTitle: Self-perceived attractiveness influences human female preferences for sexual dimorphism and symmetry in male faces\n\nAbstract: Exaggerated sexual dimorphism and symmetry in human faces have both been linked to potential \u2018good\u2013gene\u2019 benefits and have also been found to influence the attractiveness of male faces. The current study explores how female self\u2013rated attractiveness influences male face preference in females using faces manipulated with computer graphics. The study demonstrates that there is a relatively increased preference for masculinity and an increased preference for symmetry for women who regard themselves as attractive. This finding may reflect a condition\u2013dependent mating strategy analogous to behaviours found in other species. The absence of a preference for proposed markers of good genes may be adaptive in women of low mate value to avoid the costs of decreased parental investment from the owners of such characteristics.\n\n==\n\nBurriss 2011:\n\nTitle: Men\u2019s attractiveness predicts their preference for female facial femininity when judging for short-term, but not long-term, partners.\n\nAbstract: It is well established that women\u2019s preferences for masculinity are contingent on their own market-value and the duration of the sought relationship, but few studies have investigated similar effects in men. Here, we tested whether men\u2019s attractiveness predicts their preferences for feminine face shape in women when judging for long- and short-term relationship partners. We found that attractive men expressed a stronger preference for facial femininity compared to less attractive men. The relationship was evident when men judged women for a short-term, but not for a long-term, relationship. These findings suggest that market-value may influence men\u2019s preferences for feminine characteristics in women\u2019s faces and indicate that men\u2019s preferences may be subject to facultative variation to a greater degree than was previously thought.\n\n==\n\nGottschall 2007:\n\nTitle: Greater Emphasis on Female Attractiveness in Homo Sapiens: A Revised Solution to an Old Evolutionary Riddle\n\nAbstract: Substantial evidence from psychology and cross-cultural anthropology supports a general rule of greater emphasis on female physical attractiveness in Homo sapiens. As sensed by Darwin (1871) and clarified by Trivers (1972), generally higher female parental investment is a key determinant of a common pattern of sexual selection in which male animals are more competitive, more eager sexually and more conspicuous in courtship display, ornamentation, and coloration. Therefore, given the larger minimal and average parental investment of human females, keener physical attractiveness pressure among women has long been considered an evolutionary riddle. This paper briefly surveys previous thinking on the question, before offering a revised explanation for why we should expect humans to sharply depart from general zoological pattern of greater emphasis on male attractiveness. This contribution hinges on the argument that humans have been seen as anomalies mainly because we have been held up to the wrong zoological comparison groups. I argue that humans are a partially sex-role reversed species, and more emphasis on female physical attractiveness is relatively common in such species. This solution to the riddle, like those of other evolutionists, is based on peculiarities in human mating behavior, so this paper is also presented as a refinement of current thinking about the evolution of human mating preferences.\n\n==\n\nScott 2007:\n\nTitle: An evolutionary perspective on male preferences for female body shape\n\nAbstract: Cross-culturally, humans make systematic use of physical attractiveness to discriminate among members of the opposite sex, and physical cues to youth, health, and fertility may be particularly important to men (Buss, 1989). Nevertheless, there is controversy over whether attraction preferences are adaptive, particularly in novel environments, and whether they are universal or flexible depending on cultural circumstances (Singh & Luis, 1995). To date, a good deal of research into somatic (i.e., body) attractiveness has focused on two particular characteristics: waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and the body mass index (BMI). WHR is calculated as the circumference of the waist divided by circumference of the hips, and provides an index of a woman\u2019s \u2018curvaceousness.\u2019 BMI is calculated as an individual\u2019s weight (kilogrammes) divided by height (metres) squared, and provides an estimate of body fatness.\n\n==\n\nWiederman 1993:\n\nTitle: Evolved gender differences in mate preferences: Evidence from personal advertisements\n\nAbstract: Abstract Evolutionary theorists have posited that contemporary men and women may differ in their specific psychological mechanisms having to do with mate selection because different strategies would have benefitted men versus women in our distant ancestral past. From these theorized gender differences in mating strategies, several hypotheses were generated and subsequently tested in the current study using a large sample of personal advertisements ( N = 1111). The results were generally supportive of evolutionary predictions: men were more likely than women to offer financial resources and honesty/ sincerity, and to seek attractiveness, appealing body shape, and a photograph in selecting a potential mate; women were more likely than men to offer an appealing body shape and to seek financial resources, qualities likely to lead to resource acquisition, and honesty/sincerity in potential mates. Women were also more likely than men to seek male friendship and/or companionship and to offer greater involvement only after the establishment of such friendship, whereas men more frequently than women made explicit requests for a sexual relationship. In general, men sought potential mates who were younger than themselves, a trend which became more pronounced among older advertisers. Women generally sought mates who were older than themselves, a trend which decreased slightly with the age of the advertiser. Results are discussed with regard to implications for hypothesized gender differences in evolved psychological mechanisms.\n\n==\n\nConfer 2010:\n\nTitle: More than just a pretty face: Men's priority shifts toward bodily attractiveness in short-term versus long-term mating contexts\n\nAbstract: Abstract Studies of physical attractiveness have long emphasized the constituent features that make faces and bodies attractive, such as symmetry, skin texture, and waist-to-hip ratio. Few studies, however, have examined the reproductively relevant cues conveyed by faces and bodies as whole units. Based on the premise that fertility cues are more readily assessed from a woman's body than her face, the present study tested the hypothesis that men evaluating a potential short-term mate would give higher priority to information gleaned from her body, relative to her face, than men evaluating a potential long-term mate. Male and female participants ( N =375) were instructed to consider dating an opposite sex individual, whose face was occluded by a \"face box\" and whose body was occluded by a \"body box,\" as a short-term or long-term mate. With the instruction that only one box could be removed to make their decision about their willingness to engage in the designated relationship with the occluded individual, significantly more men assigned to the short-term, compared to the long-term, mating condition removed the body box. Women's face versus body information choice, in contrast, was unaffected by the temporal dimension of the mating condition. These results suggest that men, but not women, have a condition-dependent adaptive proclivity to prioritize facial cues in long-term mating contexts, but shift their priorities toward bodily cues in short-term mating contexts.\n\n==\n\nJohnston 2001:\n\nTitle: Male facial attractiveness: evidence for hormone-mediated adaptive design\n\nAbstract: Abstract Experimenters examining male facial attractiveness have concluded that the attractive male face is (1) an average male face, (2) a masculinized male face, or (3) a feminized male face. Others have proposed that symmetry, hormone markers, and the menstrual phase of the observer are important variables that influence male attractiveness. This study was designed to resolve these issues by examining the facial preferences of 42 female volunteers at two different phases of their menstrual cycle. Preferences were measured using a 40-s QuickTime movie (1200 frames) that was designed to systematically modify a facial image from an extreme male to an extreme female configuration. The results indicate that females exhibit (1) a preference for a male face on the masculine side of average, (2) a shift toward a more masculine male face preference during the high-risk phase of their menstrual cycle, and (3) no shift in other facial preferences. An examination of individual differences revealed that women who scored low on a \"masculinity\" test (1) showed a larger menstrual shift, (2) had lower self-esteem, and (3) differed in their choice of male faces for dominance and short-term mates. The results are interpreted as support for a hormonal theory of facial attractiveness whereby perceived beauty depends on an interaction between displayed hormone markers and the hormonal state of the viewer.", "final_summary": "The research question at hand explores the evolutionary basis of female attractiveness and its perceived importance by males. The collected papers provide a comprehensive insight into this intriguing topic.\n\nRozmus-Wrzesinska (2005) found that men's perception of female attractiveness is significantly influenced by changes in female waist size, suggesting that waist size, which conveys information about fecundity and health status, is more important than hip size in assessing a female's attractiveness. This is echoed by Scott (2007), who highlighted the importance of physical cues to youth, health, and fertility in male attraction preferences.\n\nLittle (2001) and Burriss (2011) both found that attractiveness influences preferences for certain facial features. Little (2001) found that women who regard themselves as attractive have a relatively increased preference for masculinity and symmetry in male faces. Burriss (2011) found that attractive men expressed a stronger preference for facial femininity compared to less attractive men, but only when judging for short-term relationships.\n\nGottschall (2007) proposed that humans are a partially sex-role reversed species, and more emphasis on female physical attractiveness is relatively common in such species. This is supported by Wiederman (1993), who found that men were more likely than women to seek attractiveness and appealing body shape in potential mates.\n\nConfer (2010) found that men prioritized bodily attractiveness over facial attractiveness when considering short-term mates, suggesting that fertility cues are more readily assessed from a woman's body. Johnston (2001) found that women exhibit a preference for a male face on the masculine side of average and that this preference shifts towards a more masculine male face during the high-risk phase of their menstrual cycle.\n\nIn conclusion, the collected papers suggest that female attractiveness, particularly bodily attractiveness, plays a significant role in male mate selection, potentially due to its association with fertility cues. This supports the research question that female attractiveness evolves compared to male attractiveness because men are more interested in attractiveness. However, the papers also highlight the complexity of attractiveness preferences, suggesting that they can be influenced by various factors, including self-perceived attractiveness and relationship context."}, {"query": "laws and policies governing climate change disinformation or misinformation", "paper_list_string": "Treen 2020:\n\nTitle: Online misinformation about climate change\n\nAbstract: Policymakers, scholars, and practitioners have all called attention to the issue of misinformation in the climate change debate.

The phrases were searched in 11 Baltic Sea Region (BSR) languages and in the Ukrainian and English languages. The results revealed that climate change disinformation and misinterpretation exists on the internet. Mostly it displayed in indirect forms such as old information, existence of junksites, advertisements, unequal share by main actors (government, mass media, etc.).

The purpose of the present laboratory experiment is to find out why people misperceive the dynamics of CO2 accumulation and how misperceptions could be avoided. Using a simulator, 242 subjects were each asked to control total global emissions of CO2 to reach a given target for the stock of CO2 in the atmosphere. Consistent with previous investigations we find a strong tendency for people to overshoot the stated goal. Furthermore, our results point out that people need help to develop proper mental models of CO2 accumulation and they need motivation to reconsider inappropriate decision heuristics. Based on these results and the literature on conceptual change a new information strategy is designed. To motivate, it imposes cognitive conflict; and to facilitate new understanding, it provides simple analogies. A new test shows promising learning effects.

A growing body of research suggests that one promising way to counteract the politicization of science is to convey the high level of normative agreement (\u201cconsensus\u201d) among experts about the reality of human\u2010caused climate change. Yet, much prior research examining public opinion dynamics in the context of climate change has done so under conditions with limited external validity. Moreover, no research to date has examined how to protect the public from the spread of influential misinformation about climate change.

Despite their importance, the links between these two trends have not been scientifically examined. This study employs a sophisticated research design on a large collection of new data, utilizing natural language processing and approximate string matching to examine the relationship between the large-scale climate misinformation movement and US philanthropy. The study finds that over a twenty year period, networks of actors promulgating scientific misinformation about climate change were increasingly integrated into the institution of US philanthropy. The degree of integration is predicted by funding ties to prominent corporate donors.

This Article examines how tort plaintiffs can establish a causal nexus between public deception and damages, drawing from past litigation, particularly claims filed against manufacturers for misleading the public about the risks of tobacco, lead paint, and opioids.

Indeed, there appears to be almost an inverse relationship between the lack of political leadership on tackling climate change and the growth in ever more sophisticated academic analyses of this complex and multifaceted problem. There is an increasing disjunction between the growth in our knowledge and understanding of the ethical, political, economic, sociological, cultural, and psychological aspects of climate change and the lack of political achievement in putting in place clear and binding targets, an agreed decarbonisation roadmap, and associated regulatory and policy instruments with enforcement. This gap might be taken as evidence that we do not need more reports on climate change.

The OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises provides a \u201cblueprint\u201d for the corporatisation and commercialisation of such enterprises, but it may be assumed that the reason for continued state ownership is that they are expected to act differently from private companies. A relatively clear case occurs when SOEs are established with the purpose of pursuing mostly non-commercial activities. In many cases, their activities might otherwise be carried out by government institutions; the SOE incorporation has been chosen mostly on efficiency grounds.A number of other rationales for public ownership of enterprises have been offered, including: (i) monopolies in sectors where competition and market regulation is not deemed feasible or efficient; (ii) market incumbency, for instance in sectors where competition has been introduced but a state-owned operator remains responsible for public service obligations; (iii) imperfect contracts, where those public service obligations that SOEs are charged with are too complex or malleable to be laid down in service contracts; (iv) industrial policy or development strategies, where SOEs are being used to overcome obstacles to growth or correct market imperfections...\n\n==\n\nMoizer 2010:\n\nTitle: Strategy making in social enterprise: The role of resource allocation and its effects on organizational sustainability\n\nAbstract: Social enterprises are non-profit organizations that seek to achieve social goals through commercial activity. Because they have both social and commercial objectives, social enterprises are confronted with high levels of complexity in their strategizing and operations; not only do they have to generate sufficient revenue to re-invest in their business operations, they also have to maintain investment in social projects in their community. Under conditions of resource scarcity, this poses severe challenges which can threaten the long-term sustainability of the enterprise. In this paper the tension between allocating resources to commercial activity and social action is explored. A simple causal-loop diagram is constructed which maps out the relationships between resource allocation and a number of other variables thought to influence the sustainability of social enterprises. By tracing through the diagram, a range of generic strategic alternatives available to social enterprises is evaluated and discussed.

For example, government postal firms typically offer overnight mail and package shipping services in direct competition with private delivery companies. In addition, many public hospitals and educational institutions compete directly with private suppliers of similar services. Production by public enterprises is particularly widespread in developing countries. During the 1980s, for example, public enterprises accounted for approximately 14 percent of gross domestic product in African nations and approximately 11 percent in developing countries as a whole.1 Typically, SOEs are required to pursue goals other than pure profit maximization. One might therefore suspect they would act less aggressively toward their competitors than would private, profit-\n\n==\n\nGroves 1937:\n\nTitle: Government Corporations and Federal Funds\n\nAbstract: The increasing use of the government corporation in the conduct of governmental business enterprises is one of the most significant of recent trends in public administration.

Most notably during the mobilization crisis of 1917 and the depression years following 1929, when speedy and vigorous action was needed, the federal government has relied heavily upon government corporations which could cut through red tape and \u201cget things done.\u201d Also in more normal times, however, particular enterprises somewhat isolated from regular governmental activities have been carried on in corporate form.\n\n==\n\nVernon-Wortzel 1989:\n\nTitle: Privatization: Not the only answer\n\nAbstract: Abstract Governments in many developing countries created state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to produce goods or provide services the private sector seemed unwilling or unable to offer. In many cases, SOEs have turned out to be problem children\u2014at best, inefficient and, at worst, unable to fulfill their original functions. Now the recommended solution to the problem of state-owned enterprises is privatization. But privatization is no more a solution to the problems of SOEs than SOEs were a solution to the problems they were created to solve. The problem of SOEs is not ownership, but rather a lack of explicit goals and objectives, and an absence of organization cultures and systems that support and encourage fulfillment of those goals and objectives. In some circumstances, privatization may aid in fulfillment of an enterprise's goals and objectives because of the culture and systems it fosters; in other cases not.\n\n==\n\nKodzi 2015:\n\nTitle: The Clash of Missions: Juxtaposing Competing Pressures in South Africa's Social Enterprises\n\nAbstract: Abstract Social enterprises seek resource combinations to provide some assurance of sustainability as they create social value in a defined domain of action. However, this resource-seeking mandate also constitutes a distraction that complicates the operations of any social enterprise. How do social enterprises manage the implicit duality of maintaining a commercial mission in order to achieve their social mission? Using the context of South Africa, this study examines the process trade-offs that enhance or limit social impact under the referenced duality. The study clarifies the nature of these trade-offs, as a basis for appropriating efficiency-enhancing process design in enterprises that create, but do not capture value.

A third party can punish the dictator after observing the dictator\u2019s decision and the resulting payoffs. On the one hand, willfully ignorant dictators are punished less if their actions lead to unfair outcomes than dictators who reveal the consequences before implementing the same outcome.

Recipients only compete in a skill-testing contest, the outcome of which determines the size of the surplus. In the dictator game, Allocators reward skillful Recipients, but punish unskillful ones only modestly. The punishment effect is mitigated by the belief held by some Allocators that effort is the appropriate measure of deservingness. The ultimatum game extension reveals offerers' ability to adapt to the strategic environment. Offers to skillful Recipients in the ultimatum game, however, are shown to be motivated by a taste for fairness, and not strategic considerations.

Subjects made dictator allocations of $40 before and after learning the allocation made by one other subject in the Relevant Information treatment, or the birthday of one other subject in the Irrelevant Information treatment. Subjects on average become more self-regarding in the Irrelevant Information treatment, but observing relevant information constrains some subjects from moving toward more self-regarding choices. We also find that subjects who exhibit more self-regarding behavior on their first decisions are less likely to change choices between their first and second decisions, and the use of the Strategy Method in this setting does not significantly alter choices. The relationships between our findings and the economic and psychological literature regarding how social influence operates are also explored.

In our laboratory experiment subjects decide on a series of mini-Dictator games while under varying degrees of cognitive load. Cognitive load is intended to decrease deliberation and therefore enhance the influence of affect on behavior. In each game subjects have two options: they can decide between a fair and an unfair allocation. We find that subjects in a high-load condition are more generous \u2013 they more often choose the fair allocation than subjects in a low-load condition. The series of mini-Dictator games also allows us to investigate how subjects react to the games\u2019 varying levels of advantageous inequality.

Depleted dictators give considerably less than non-depleted dictators and hence exhibit strong preferences for selfish allocation. In contrast to earlier studies, participants were explicitly paid for completing the egodepletion task (with either a flat rate or strictly performance-based payment). We studied the dynamics of decisions by repeating the dictator game 12 times (anonymously). Depleted dictators start with much lower offers than non-depleted ones, but, strikingly, offers decrease in time for both groups, and more rapidly so for non-depleted dictators. We conclude that, while depleted dictators neglect fairness motives from the very first decision on, non-depleted dictators initially resist the tendency to act selfishly, but eventually become depleted or learn to act selfishly. Hence, prosocial behavior may be short-lived, and ego depletion uncovers the default tendencies for selfishness earlier.\n\n==\n\nDana 2006:\n\nTitle: What you don't know won't hurt me: Costly (but quiet) exit in dictator games\n\nAbstract: We used simple economic games to examine pro-social behavior and the lengths that people will take in order to avoid engaging in it. Over two studies, we found that about one third of participants were willing to exit a $10 dictator game and take $9 instead. The exit option left the receiver nothing, but also ensured that the receiver never knew that a dictator game was to be played. Because most social utility models are defined over monetary outcomes, they cannot explain choosing the ($9, $0) exit outcome over the dominating $10 dictator game, since the game includes outcomes of ($10, $0) and ($9, $1). We also studied exiting using a private dictator game. In the private game, the receiver never knew about the game or from where any money was received. Gifts in this game were added innocuously to a payment for a separate task. Almost no dictators exited from the private game, indicating that receivers' beliefs are the key factor in the decision to exit. When, as in the private game, the receivers' beliefs and expectations cannot be manipulated by exit, exit is seldom taken. We conclude that giving often reflects a desire not to violate others' expectations rather than a concern for others' welfare per se. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding ethical decisions and for testing and modeling social preferences. An adequate specification of social preferences should include \"psychological\" payoffs that directly incorporate beliefs about actions into the utility function.\n\n==\n\nEdele 2013:\n\nTitle: Explaining altruistic sharing in the dictator game : The role of affective empathy, cognitive empathy, and justice sensitivity\n\nAbstract: Abstract Experimental games like the dictator game have proven of great value for the study of altruism and sharing behavior. It has been shown that individuals differ substantially in the amount of money they offer to an anonymous receiver. Yet, to date little is known about how personality dispositions shape differences in altruistic sharing. The current study aimed at elucidating the effects of affective empathy in comparison to cognitive empathy and the disposition of justice sensitivity on altruistic sharing in the dictator game. Different aspects of these constructs were assessed multi-methodologically in young adults and related to their offers in the dictator game. Analyses revealed that affective empathy and justice sensitivity explain altruistic sharing behavior, but different dimensions of cognitive empathy do not. The results support the assumption that affective reaction tendencies explain differences in altruistic sharing.\n\n==\n\nG\u0105siorowska 2012:\n\nTitle: Psychological consequences of money and money attitudes in dictator game\n\nAbstract: According to the research conducted by Vohs, Mead, and Goode (2006, 2008), reminders of money cause people to behave self-sufficiently, and especially to reveal a reduced tendency to charitable behaviour. In this study, we wanted to establish if this tendency would be present in the dictator game, and if so, whether money activation would just change behaviour, or whether it would also change people\u2019s evaluation of their own decisions. We assumed that people who revealed symbolic and instrumental money attitudes would react differently to money activation. As expected, money priming caused smaller money transfers compared to the control condition, and this effect was significant among those with symbolic attitudes toward money. Moreover, participants who transferred at least half of the sum after money activation declared stronger negative emotions and lower satisfaction with the decision than those who made similar transfers in the control condition.", "final_summary": "Deliberate ignorance, or willful ignorance, plays a complex role in the dynamics of the dictator game, a popular experimental tool in economics and psychology. The dictator game involves one player, the \"dictator,\" who is given a sum of money to split between themselves and another player, the \"receiver.\" The dictator's decision is unilateral and the receiver must accept whatever is offered.\n\nBartling (2013) found that dictators who chose to remain willfully ignorant about the consequences of their actions for the receiver were punished less if their actions led to unfair outcomes. However, the act of remaining willfully ignorant was itself punished, regardless of the outcome. This suggests that while deliberate ignorance can shield dictators from punishment when outcomes are unfair, it can also invite punishment in and of itself.\n\nSchulz (2014) explored the impact of cognitive load on other-regarding decisions in the dictator game. The study found that subjects under high cognitive load were more generous, suggesting that affect plays a significant role in decision-making. Achtziger (2015) studied the effects of ego depletion on social preferences in the dictator game and found that depleted dictators gave considerably less than non-depleted dictators, indicating that self-control resources may influence prosocial behavior.\n\nDana (2006) found that about one third of participants were willing to exit a dictator game and take less money, leaving the receiver with nothing but also ensuring the receiver never knew a game was to be played. This suggests that some dictators may use deliberate ignorance as a strategy to avoid engaging in prosocial behavior.\n\nEdele (2013) explored the role of empathy in the dictator game and found that affective empathy and justice sensitivity explain altruistic sharing behavior. G\u0105siorowska (2012) explored the role of money attitudes in the dictator game and found that reminders of money caused smaller money transfers, especially among those with symbolic attitudes toward money.\n\nIn conclusion, the role of deliberate ignorance in the dictator game is complex and multifaceted. While it can serve as a shield against punishment in some cases (Bartling, 2013), it can also invite punishment (Bartling, 2013) and be used as a strategy to avoid prosocial behavior (Dana, 2006). Other factors such as cognitive load (Schulz, 2014), ego depletion (Achtziger, 2015), empathy (Edele, 2013), and money attitudes (G\u0105siorowska, 2012) also influence decision-making and behavior in the dictator game.

Remobilization of assimilates is an active process that involves translocation of stored reserves from stems and sheaths to grains (Gupta et al., 2015).

This study was conducted to determine the effects of water deficit during the post-jointing period on quantitative changes in water soluble carbohydrates (WSC; including simple sugars, starch, and fructans) in the stems of spring wheat. Cultivars Edwall and Waverly were planted in 1983 and 1984 at Spillman Agronomy Farm near Pullman, WA, at rates of 94 and 168 kg per ha in rows 30 and 15 cm apart, respectively, in both irrigated and nonirrigated treatments. Beginning at jointing, plants were harvested weekly. Stem material was dried, milled, digested with amyloglucosidase, and analyzed for WSC by iodometric titration. Results were similar for both varieties and both years. Anthesis and peak stem carbohydrate concentration occurred 4 to 7 d earlier in nonirrigated than irrigated plants; and physiological maturity of the grain occurred 6 to 14 days earlier. The concentration of WSC in stems increased to between 250 and 380 mg per g dry wt. at approximately equal to 10 to 14 d after anthesis and then declined to less than 50 mg per g dry wt. by physiological maturity of the grain. From the time of peak WSC content until physiological maturity in 1984, 959 to 1235 mg WSC were lost from the stems of irrigated plants but only 619 to 662 mg WSC were lost from stems of nonirrigated plants.

An alternative source of carbon for grain filling is stored stem reserves. Two spring wheat cultivars (V5 and V2183) of very similar phenology and plant stature, which had previously been found to differ in grain shrivelling under drought and heat stress conditions in the field, were used to evaluate the hypothesis that the mobilisation of stored stem reserves into the growing grain is an important source of carbon for supporting grain filling under heat stress. In two experiments in Israel (1990 and 1991), the rates of stem dry matter (DM) and stem total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) loss, grain growth and leaf senescence were monitored under optimal (control) and high (stressed) temperatures in the glasshouse (1990) and the growth chamber (1991). Cultivar V5 always sustained a smaller reduction in grain dry weight under heat stress, than V2183. Irrespective of temperature, V5 had a higher stem DM and TNC content at the onset of grain filling, greater depletion of stem dry matter (or TNC) during grain filling, and longer duration of grain filling, than V2183. During grain filling V5 generally exported about two to three times more DM from the stems than V2183, under both non-stressed and stressed conditions. On the other hand, V5 was more heat-susceptible than V2183 in terms of leaf longevity, in vivo chlorophyll stability and grain abortion under heat stress. In a third experiment (1992) five cultivars (including V5 and V2183) were subjected to chemical desiccation (0.3% potassium iodide) of the canopy in the field in order to destroy the photosynthetic source ofthe plant after anthesis. The same cultivars were subjected to heat stress (35/25oC) or non-stressed (25/15oC) conditions after anthesis in the growth chamber. It was found that grain dry weight reduction by chemical desiccation was highly correlated with grain dry weight reduction by heat stress (r2 = 0.89). Therefore, the superior capacity of V5 for grain filling from mobilised stem reserves is a consti- tutive trait which supports grain filling under heat stress which can be tested for by chemical desiccation of plants under non-stressed conditions.\n\n==\n\nSrivastava 2017:\n\nTitle: Effect of stem reserve mobilization on grain filling under drought stress conditions in recombinant inbred population of wheat\n\nAbstract: Pre-anthesis carbon assimilation of stem reserves is considered as an important source for grain filling during post anthesis drought stresses that inhibit photosynthesis. 175 RILs from cross (C518/2*PBW343) along with check cultivars were evaluated for stem reserve mobilization under irrigated and rainfed conditions. These two cultivars belonging to distinct adaptation mechanism, offer several morpho -physiological and biochemical con-trasts. C 518 is tall and adapted to low input rainfed conditions whereas PBW 343 is semi -dwarf and input re-sponsive. Further C 518 is known for better stem reserves on account of larger peduncle and strong commitment to grain filling due to effective stem reserve mobilization. The parents and the RIL population was tested for stem reserve mobilization by defoliation of flag leaf and second leaf at anthesis under irrigated and rainfed environments. Evaluated entries differed significantly (pl0.001) for reduction in 1000 grain weight under defoliation (TGWL). Percent reduction in 1000 grain weight ranged from 4.4 % to 39.6 % under irrigated environment and 3.2 % to 35.0 under rainfed condition. A significant positive correlation (r = +0.357) between stem reserve mobilization and peduncle length was observed under rainfed condition. Tested RILs vary individually for stem reserve mobilization when subjected to removal of flag leaf and second leaf inhibiting the photosynthesis. The genotypes with better stem reserve mobilization based on 1000 grain weight in the absence of photosynthesis may also provide relative tolerance to drought.\n\n==\n\nSharbatkhari 2016:\n\nTitle: Wheat stem reserves and salinity tolerance: molecular dissection of fructan biosynthesis and remobilization to grains\n\nAbstract: AbstractMain conclusionFructan accumulation and remobilization to grains under salinity can decrease dependency of the wheat tolerant cultivar on current photosynthesis and protect it from severe yield loss under salt stress.\n Tolerance of plants to abiotic stresses can be enhanced by accumulation of soluble sugars, such as fructan. The current research sheds light on the role of stem fructan remobilization on yield of bread wheat under salt stress conditions. Fructan accumulation and remobilization as well as relative expression of the major genes of fructan metabolism were investigated in the penultimate internodes of \u2018Bam\u2019 as the salt-tolerant and \u2018Ghods\u2019 as the salt-sensitive wheat cultivars under salt-stressed and controlled conditions and their correlations were analyzed. More fructan production and higher efficiency of fructan remobilization was detected in Bam cultivar under salinity. Up-regulation of sucrose: sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST) and sucrose: fructan 6-fructosyltransferase (6-SFT) (fructan biosynthesis genes) at anthesis and up-regulation of fructan exohydrolase (1-FEH) and vacuolar invertase (IVR) genes (contributed to fructan metabolism) during grain filling stage and higher expression of sucrose transporter gene (SUT1) in Bam was in accordance with its induced fructan accumulation and remobilization under salt stress. A significant correlation was observed between weight density, WSCs and gene expression changes under salt stress. Based on the these results, increased fructan production and induced stem reserves remobilization under salinity can decrease dependency of the wheat tolerant cultivar on current photosynthesis and protect it from severe yield loss under salt stress conditions.\n\n==\n\nGupta 2011:\n\nTitle: Stem Reserve Mobilization and Sink Activity in Wheat under Drought Conditions\n\nAbstract: The effect of water deficit on stem reserve mobilization and sink activity in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars, viz., C306 (drought tolerant) and PBW343 (drought sensitive) was studied. Drought was maintained in pot raised plants by withholding irrigation at 95 days after sowing (DAS), i.e. just five days before the initiation of anthesis. Drought induced a significant reduction in mean biomass of all the internodes of sensitive cultivar as compared to those of tolerant one. Mobilized dry matter and mobilization efficiency were observed to be higher in the internodes of tolerant cultivar, both under control and stress conditions, which resulted in enhanced translocation of stem reserves to the grains. Water soluble carbohydrates (WSC), which mainly occur as fructans, were observed to be higher in the internodes of tolerant cultivar than those of sensitive one. When drought was applied, fructans were mobilized more effectively from the internodes of tolerant cultivar. A significantly higher sucrose synthase activity in the grains of tolerant cultivar, under drought conditions, increased the sink strength by unloading the assimilates in the sink, thereby increasing further mobilization of assimilates to the grains. Grains of sensitive cultivar attained maturity much earlier as compared to the tolerant one, both under control and stress conditions. The longer duration of grain maturation in tolerant cultivar supported enhanced mobilization of stem reserves, thus restricting heavy decrease in grain yield, under stress conditions, as compared to the sensitive cultivar. It may, therefore, be concluded that certain characteristics viz., enhanced capability of fructan storage, higher mobilization efficiency, stronger sink activity and longer duration of grain maturation might help the drought tolerant cultivar in coping the stress conditions", "final_summary": "The mobilization of stem sugar reserves in wheat, particularly under stress conditions, is a critical factor in grain filling and overall yield. Ram (2018) found that stem reserves can contribute up to 70% of grain weight under stress conditions, such as drought and high temperatures. This is echoed by Blum (1997, 2004), who highlighted the importance of stem reserves for grain filling when photosynthesis is inhibited by stressors like drought, heat, or disease. \n\nDavidson (1992) further emphasized the role of stem reserves, noting that they serve as a significant temporary storage site for carbohydrates in both irrigated and non-irrigated plants. Blum (1994) suggested that the mobilization of stem reserves can support grain filling under heat stress, providing an alternative source of carbon when photosynthesis is impaired. \n\nSrivastava (2017) found a positive correlation between stem reserve mobilization and peduncle length under rainfed conditions, suggesting that genotypes with better stem reserve mobilization may exhibit relative tolerance to drought. Sharbatkhari (2016) found that increased fructan production and induced stem reserves remobilization under salinity can decrease dependency on current photosynthesis and protect wheat from severe yield loss under salt stress conditions. \n\nLastly, Gupta (2011) concluded that characteristics such as enhanced capability of fructan storage, higher mobilization efficiency, stronger sink activity, and longer duration of grain maturation might help drought-tolerant cultivars cope with stress conditions. \n\nIn conclusion, the mobilization of stem sugar reserves in wheat is a crucial factor in grain filling, particularly under stress conditions. This process can contribute significantly to grain weight and yield, providing an alternative source of carbon when photosynthesis is impaired. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and genetic factors influencing stem reserve mobilization and its impact on wheat yield under various stress conditions."}, {"query": "Health economic benefits of reducing NHS waiting times", "paper_list_string": "Cooper 2009:\n\nTitle: Equity, waiting times, and NHS reforms: retrospective study\n\nAbstract: Objective To determine whether observable changes in waiting times occurred for certain key elective procedures between 1997 and 2007 in the English National Health Service and to analyse the distribution of those changes between socioeconomic groups as an indicator of equity. Design Retrospective study of population-wide, patient level data using ordinary least squares regression to investigate the statistical relation between waiting times and patients\u2019 socioeconomic status. Setting English NHS from 1997 to 2007. Participants 427\u2009277 patients who had elective knee replacement, 406\u2009253 who had elective hip replacement, and 2\u2009568\u2009318 who had elective cataract repair. Main outcome measures Days waited from referral for surgery to surgery itself; socioeconomic status based on Carstairs index of deprivation. Results Mean and median waiting times rose initially and then fell steadily over time. By 2007 variation in waiting times across the population tended to be lower. In 1997 waiting times and deprivation tended to be positively related. By 2007 the relation between deprivation and waiting time was less pronounced, and, in some cases, patients from the most deprived fifth were waiting less time than patients from the most advantaged fifth. Conclusions Between 1997 and 2007 waiting times for patients having elective hip replacement, knee replacement, and cataract repair in England went down and the variation in waiting times for those procedures across socioeconomic groups was reduced. Many people feared that the government\u2019s NHS reforms would lead to inequity, but inequity with respect to waiting times did not increase; if anything, it decreased. Although proving that the later stages of those reforms, which included patient choice, provider competition, and expanded capacity, was a catalyst for improvements in equity is impossible, the data show that these reforms, at a minimum, did not harm equity.\n\n==\n\nGiuntella 2015:\n\nTitle: The Effects of Immigration on NHS Waiting Times\n\nAbstract: This paper analyzes the effects of immigration on waiting times for the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Linking administrative records from Hospital Episode Statistics (2003-2012) with immigration data drawn from the UK Labour Force Survey, we find that immigration reduced waiting times for outpatient referrals and did not have significant effects on waiting times in accident and emergency departments (A&E) and elective care. The reduction in outpatient waiting times can be explained by the fact that immigration increases natives' internal mobility and that immigrants tend to be healthier than natives who move to different areas. Finally, we find evidence that immigration increased waiting times for outpatient referrals in more deprived areas outside of London. The increase in average waiting times in more deprived areas is concentrated in the years immediately following the 2004 EU enlargement and disappears in the medium term (e.g., 3-4 years).\n\n==\n\nHarrison 2009:\n\nTitle: Reducing Waiting Times for Hospital Treatment: Lessons from the English NHS\n\nAbstract: In recent years, the English NHS has achieved substantial reductions in waiting times for hospital treatment. This paper considers first whether the data used by the Government provide an accurate description of changes in waiting times and identifies some of the limitations of the measures used. It then attempts to identify how reductions have been achieved. It argues that some features of central government policy have been important - such as the use of targets - others, such as the introduction of new private sector capacity have not. It also shows that changes at local level have been critical to achieving the recorded improvements, but the precise impact of these is hard to identify.\n\n==\n\nMarques 2014:\n\nTitle: Disclosing total waiting times for joint replacement: evidence from the English NHS using linked HES data.\n\nAbstract: For the last decade, stringent monitoring of waiting time performance targets provided English hospitals with incentives to reduce official waiting times for elective surgery. It is less clear whether the total amount of time patients waited in secondary care, from first referral to outpatient clinic until treatment, has also fallen. We used Hospital Episode Statistics inpatient data for patients undergoing total joint replacement during a period of active monitoring of targets (between 2006/7 and 2008/9) and linked it to outpatient data to reconstruct patients' pathway in the 3\u2009years before surgery and provide alternative measurements of waiting times. Our findings suggest that although official waiting times decreased drastically in our study period, total waiting time in secondary care has not declined. Patients with shorter official waits spent a longer time in a 'work-up' period prior to inclusion in the official waiting list, and socio-economic inequities persisted in waiting times for joint replacement. We found no evidence that target policies achieved efficiency gains during our study period.\n\n==\n\nHamilton 1999:\n\nTitle: The Impact of the NHS Reforms on Queues and Surgical Outcomes in England: Evidence From Hip Fracture Patients\n\nAbstract: National Health Service (NHS) reform introduced incentives for efficiency and cost effectiveness, yet little is known about their effectiveness in reducing waiting times for surgery or improving postsurgical outcomes. This paper finds that waiting times for hip fracture surgery declined after the NHS reforms and patients were more likely to be discharged to another provider. However, hospitals have not simply shifted the burden of care to other providers, since lengths of stay ending in a discharge to home fell. The effect of wait time on surgical outcomes is small in magnitude and cannot explain the postreform improvements in outcomes.\n\n==\n\nPropper 2002:\n\nTitle: Waiting times for hospital admissions: the impact of GP fundholding.\n\nAbstract: Waiting times for hospital care are a significant issue in the UK National Health Service (NHS). The reforms of the health service in 1990 gave a subset of family doctors (GP fundholders) both the ability to choose the hospital where their patients were treated and the means to pay for some services. One of the key factors influencing family doctors' choice of hospital was patient waiting time. However, without cash inducements, hospitals would get no direct reward from giving shorter waiting times to a subset of patients. Using a unique dataset, we investigate whether GP fundholders were able to secure shorter waiting times for their patients, whether they were able to do so in cases where they had no financial rewards to offer hospitals, and whether the impact of fundholding spilled over into shorter waiting times for all patients.\n\n==\n\nSiciliani 2005:\n\nTitle: Tackling excessive waiting times for elective surgery: a comparative analysis of policies in 12 OECD countries.\n\nAbstract: This paper compares policies to tackle excessive waiting times for elective surgery in 12 OECD countries. It is found that waiting times may be reduced by acting on the supply of or on the demand for surgery (or both). On the supply side, evidence suggests that both capacity and financial incentives towards productivity can play an important role. On the demand side, inducing a raising of clinical thresholds may reduce waiting times but may also provoke tension between clinicians and policy makers. Preliminary evidence also suggests that an increase in private health insurance coverage may reduce waiting times.\n\n==\n\nJones 2010:\n\nTitle: The four hour target to reduce emergency department \u2018waiting time\u2019: A systematic review of clinical outcomes\n\nAbstract: Governments in Australasia are introducing emergency department length of stay (EDLOS) time targets similar to the UK \u2018four hour rule\u2019. There is debate about whether this rule had beneficial effects on health\u2010care outcomes. We sought to determine what effects the four hour time target for EDLOS had on clinically relevant outcomes in the UK by conducting a systematic search for evidence. Articles were screened by both authors independently and assessed for quality using standard tools. Differences in outcomes measured and how they were measured precluded meta\u2010analysis. There were inconsistencies between target achievement reported by Trusts and that reported in the studies, and empirical evidence that the target might be unattainable. National Health Service spending on ED increased \u00a3820\u2003000\u2003000.00 (1998\u20132007) and emergency admissions rose overall by 35% (2002\u20132006), but not in all hospitals. Time to see a treating clinician and hospital mortality was unchanged. One hospital demonstrated a small reduction in return rate. The impact of the introduction of an ED time target and the associated massive financial investment has not resulted in a consistent improvement in care with markedly varying effects being reported between hospitals. Countries seeking to emulate the UK experience should proceed with caution.", "final_summary": "The economic benefits of reducing waiting times in the National Health Service (NHS) have been a topic of extensive research. The findings, however, are varied and complex.\n\nCooper (2009) found that between 1997 and 2007, waiting times for elective procedures in the NHS decreased, and the variation in waiting times across socioeconomic groups was reduced. This suggests that reducing waiting times can lead to more equitable healthcare access. Similarly, Harrison (2009) noted that the English NHS achieved substantial reductions in waiting times for hospital treatment, attributing this to certain government policies such as the use of targets.\n\nHowever, Marques (2014) found that while official waiting times decreased, the total waiting time in secondary care did not decline.

The University of the West of Scotland has been offering flexible postgraduate programmes in Alcohol and Drugs Studies online since 1999 and uses Blackboard, the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), to support equated learning. The explicit focus of this continuing longitudinal study (dating originally from 2002) is on student achievement. In this continuing evaluation comparing on-campus and online student grade performance, online study groups have exactly the same module syllabus as their on-campus counterparts. There is equivalence of support in that students on both modes of study are taught on the same traditional 15-week trimesters as students on the on-campus version, have the same learning materials, live interactive lectures using the VLE as a central hub, and the same assessment methods including assignments, projects, and class tests. Most importantly, the online and oncampus modes of study had the same learning outcomes, the same academic module moderator and also the same external examiner to ensure that assessed work by students on each mode of study was marked to the same standard. Statistical analysis of academic outcomes revealed no significant differences in grades (summative marks) between online and on-campus groups.

Prior to the pandemic, online education was providing higher education to students who were returning to study to up-skill, are employed full-time, caring for family members, living rurally or remotely and/or for whom otherwise face-to-face campus learning was not a preference or option. To understand how we can better support online students in their unique circumstances and create an optimal learning environment, we must understand the factors associated with academic achievement within an online setting. This systematic review involved a search of relevant databases published between January 2009 and May 2021 examining factors and constructs related to academic performance in online higher education settings. Across 34 papers, 23 (67.6%) explored factors and constructs related to student characteristics including cognitive and psychological, demographic, university enrolment, and prior academic performance. Twenty-one (61.8%) papers explored learning environment factors including engagement, student experience, course design, and instructor. Our overall synthesis of findings indicates that academic performance in online learning is most strongly associated with motivation (including self-efficacy), and self-regulation. We propose three main implications of our review for online learning stakeholders such as educators and designers. Firstly, we argue that the wellbeing of online learners is important to understand, and future research should explore its impact on students\u2019 experience and success in online higher education. Secondly, we emphasise the importance of developing and designing online courses utilising relevant frameworks and evidence-based principles. Finally, we propose an approach to promoting improved student cognitive and psychosocial experiences (such as self-efficacy, self-regulation, and perceived support) could be achieved by creating and incorporating an online learning orientation module at the commencement of enrolment.

Apart from mode of delivery, the characteristics of the course stayed nearly identical throughout. Exam and homework assignment scores are used as measures of performance. Although mean comparisons and basic regressions indicate that online students outperform F2F students on exams, once self-selection is addressed, online students no more outperform F2F students.

The travel distance between each student's home and college campus served as an instrument for the likelihood of enrolling in an online section of a given course. In addition, college-by-course fixed effects controlled for within- and between-course selection bias. Analyses yield robust negative estimates for online learning in terms of both course persistence and course grade, contradicting the notion that there is no significant difference between online and face-to-face student outcomes\u2014at least within the community college setting.

In HCl-NaAc buffer solutions with the pH value of 1.42, chlorine dioxide, or chlorine, oxidizes I- to form 12, which then reacts with the excess I- to form I3-. The resulting 13- would combine, respectively, with four rhodamine(Rh) dyes, including rhodamine B (RhB), butyl rhodamine B (b-RhB), rhodamine 6G (RhG), and rhodamine S (RhS), to form association particles which exhibit a stronger resonance scattering (RS) effect at 420 nm. For four systems of RhB, bRhB, RhG, and RhS, chlorine dioxide was, respectively, determined in the concentration range of 0.0056 to approximately 0.787 mg/L, 0.0034 to approximately 0.396 mg/L, 0.0057 to approximately 0.795 mg/L, and 0.0052 to approximately 0.313 mg/L, with the detection limits of 0.0011 mg/L, 0.006 mg/L, 0.0054 mg/ L, and 0.0023 mg/L ClO2, respectively.

The total RS value originally from ClO2 and Cl2 was recorded in the buffer solution, while the RS value from ClO2 was obtained by using dimethyl sulfoxide to mask chlorine. Thus the RS value of chlorine was calculated by deducting the RS value of chlorine dioxide from the total RS value.

In order to better understand the performance of ClO2 in water treatment, the kinetics and mechanisms of ClO2 reactions with inorganic and organic compounds found in waters are critically reviewed. In the case of inorganic compounds, ClO2 reacts with I\u2212, CN\u2212, NO2\u2212, SO32\u2212, Fe(II) and Mn(II) rapidly at apparent second-order reaction rate constants (kapp) of 102\u2013106 M\u22121 s\u22121 at pH 7.0 and barely reacts with NH4+ and Br\u2212. In the case of organic compounds, ClO2 selectively reacts with compounds with electron-rich moieties, such as phenols (kapp = 103\u2013109 M\u22121 s\u22121), anilines (kapp = 105\u2013108 M\u22121 s\u22121), and thiols (kapp > 108 M\u22121 s\u22121). ClO2 also shows high reactivity towards aliphatic tertiary amines and heterocyclic nitrogenous compounds (i.e., indoles and piperidines) with kapp of 101\u2013106 M\u22121 s\u22121 at pH 7.0, but low reactivity with unsaturated structures (i.e., olefins and aldehydes). The kapp values at pH 7.0 in ClO2 oxidation vary over 14 orders of magnitude. Electron transfer is the dominant pathway for ClO2 reactions. Quantitative structure\u2013activity relationships (QSARs) can be used to predict the species-specific secondary reaction rate constants for ClO2 oxidation of compounds containing phenolic and amine structures. Little modifications are expected on the structure of the parent compounds upon the primary attack of ClO2, but further oxidation generally leads to the formation of quinones, aldehydes and carboxylic acids. Furthermore, the transformation kinetics of inorganic compounds, typical organic compounds and emerging micropollutants are compared and their half-life times under typical water treatment conditions during ClO2 oxidation are calculated.\n\n==\n\nHuber 2005:\n\nTitle: Oxidation of pharmaceuticals during water treatment with chlorine dioxide.\n\nAbstract: The potential of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) for the oxidation of pharmaceuticals during water treatment was assessed by determining second-order rate constants for the reaction with selected environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals. Out of 9 pharmaceuticals only the 4 following compounds showed an appreciable reactivity with ClO2 (in brackets apparent second-order rate constants at pH 7 and T = 20 degrees C): the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (6.7 x 10(3) M(-1) s(-1)), the macrolide antibiotic roxithromycin (2.2 x 10(2) M(-1) s(-1)), the estrogen 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (approximately 2 x 10(5) M(-1) s(-1)), and the antiphlogistic diclofenac (1.05 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)). Experiments performed using natural water showed that ClO2 also reacted fast with other sulfonamides and macrolides, the natural hormones estrone and 17beta-estradiol as well as 3 pyrazolone derivatives (phenazone, propylphenazone, and dimethylaminophenazone). However, many compounds in the study were ClO2 refractive. Experiments with lake water and groundwater that were partly performed at microgram/L to nanogram/L levels proved that the rate constants determined in pure water could be applied to predict the oxidation of pharmaceuticals in natural waters. Compared to ozone, ClO2 reacted more slowly and with fewer compounds. However, it reacted faster with the investigated compounds than chlorine. Overall, the results indicate that ClO2 will only be effective to oxidize certain compound classes such as the investigated classes of sulfonamide and macrolide antibiotics, and estrogens.\n\n==\n\nQuentel 1994:\n\nTitle: Electrochemical determination of low levels of residual chlorine dioxide in tap water\n\nAbstract: The reaction between 1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone-3-sulphonic acid and chlorine dioxide, in phosphate buffer medium, was studied spectrophotometrically and electrochemically.

Spring Hollow Water Treatment Facility and monitored concentrations of the oxidant and its by\u2010products within the facility and distribution system. Project objectives were to (1) document changes in ClO2, chlorite ion (ClO2\u2013), and chlorate ion (ClO3\u2013) concentrations throughout the facility and distribution system following raw water ClO2 pretreatment; (2) evaluate ClO2\u2013 removal by the postfilter granular activated carbon (GAC) contactors; and (3) determine distribution system ClO2 concentrations associated with odor complaints. The average raw water ClO2 dose was 0.4 mg/L, and overall ClO2\u2013 removals by GAC averaged 63% but declined markedly with increasing throughput volume. Distribution system ClO2\u2013 concentrations were generally <0.2 mg/L and decreased with increasing distance from the treatment facility; ClO3\u2013 never exceeded 0.1 mg/L. ClO2 was measured at low concentrations (0.017\u20130.17 mg/L) in the distribution system, and a measured concentration of 0.03 mg/L was found at the home of one customer who complained of odors.\n\n==\n\nKang 2006:\n\nTitle: [A new fluorescence quenching method for the determination of trace ClO2 in water using silver nanoparticles].\n\nAbstract: In pH 9.1 NH4Cl-NH3 x H2O buffer solution, there is a fluorescence peak at 470 nm for silver nanoparticles.

The large-scale dynamical effects were manifest throughout the stratosphere and upper troposphere, corresponding to two distinct cyclonic centers in the upper troposphere\u2013stratosphere system. High-resolution (T511) ECMWF analyses, supplemented by analyses from the Met Office, are used to present a detailed dynamical analysis of the event. First, the anomalous evolution of the SH polar vortex is placed in the context of the evolution that is usually witnessed during spring. Then high-resolution fields of potential vorticity (PV) from ECMWF are used to reveal several dynamical features of the split. Vortex fragments are rapidly sheared out into sheets of high (modulus) PV, which subsequently roll up into distinct synoptic-scale vortices.

This event led to a large increase in the temperature of the polar stratosphere and to the reversal of the zonal wind. Unlike other major SSW events in recent winters, after the major SSW in January 2010 the westerlies and polar vortex did not recover to their pre-SSW strength until the springtime transition. As a result, the depletion of the ozone layer inside the polar vortex over the entire winter was relatively small over the past 20 years. The other distinguishing feature of the 2010 winter was the splitting of the stratospheric polar vortex into two lobes in December. The vortex splitting was accompanied by an increase in the temperature of the polar stratosphere and a weakening of the westerlies but with no reversal. The splitting occurred when, in addition to the high-pressure system over northeastern Eurasia and the northern Pacific Ocean, the tropospheric anticyclone over Europe amplified and extended to the lower stratosphere. Analysis of wave activity in the extratropical troposphere revealed that two Rossby wave trains propagated eastward to the North Atlantic several days prior to the vortex splitting. The first wave train propagated from the subtropics and mid-latitudes of the eastern Pacific Ocean over North America and the second one propagated from the northern Pacific Ocean. These wave trains contributed to an intensification of the tropospheric anticyclone over Europe and to the splitting of the stratospheric polar vortex.\n\n==\n\nPalmer 1959:\n\nTitle: The stratospheric polar vortex in winter\n\nAbstract: In winter the polar stratospheric air within the earth's shadow forms the core of an intense \u2018cold low\u2019 which extends from about 10 km to at least 50 km and possibly to the base of the ionosphere. Compared with the tropospheric general circulation, this vortex seems to be remarkably stable, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. \n \nRecent research work in Canada and the United States on the characteristics of the vortex is reviewed. The chief conclusions are that the vortex is more stable in the Southern than in the Northern Hemisphere, that \u2018explosive warmings\u2019 in the lower stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere follow the breakdown of the vortex at high levels close to the pole, and that the breakdown extends from above downward over a period of several days. It is suggested that the high-level breakdown is correlated with solar activity.\n\n==\n\nWaugh 1994:\n\nTitle: Transport out of the lower stratospheric Arctic vortex by Rossby wave breaking\n\nAbstract: The fine-scale structure in lower stratospheric tracer transport during the period of the two Arctic Airborne Stratospheric Expeditions (January and February 1989; December 1991 to March 1992) is investigated using contour advection with surgery calculations. These calculations show that Rossby wave breaking is an ongoing occurrence during these periods and that air is ejected from the polar vortex in the form of long filamentary structures. There is good qualitative agreement between these filaments and measurements of chemical tracers taken aboard the NASA ER-2 aircraft. The ejected air generally remains filamentary and is stretched and mixed with midlatitude air as it is wrapped around the vortex. This process transfers vortex air into midlatitudes and also produces a narrow region of fine-scale filaments surrounding the polar vortex. Among other things, this makes it difficult to define a vortex edge. The calculations also show that strong stirring can occur inside as well as outside the vortex.\n\n==\n\nManney 2000:\n\nTitle: Development of the polar vortex in the 1999\u20132000 Arctic winter stratosphere\n\nAbstract: The 1999\u20132000 Arctic stratospheric vortex was unusually cold, especially in the early winter lower stratosphere, with a larger area near polar stratospheric cloud formation temperatures in Dec and Jan, and much lower temperatures averaged over Nov\u2013Jan, than any previously observed Arctic winter. In Nov and early Dec, there was a double jet in the upper stratosphere, with the anticyclone cutoff in a region of cyclonic material. By late Dec, there was a discontinuous vortex, large in the upper stratosphere, small in the lower stratosphere; evolving to a strong, continuous, relatively upright vortex by mid\u2010Jan. This vortex evolution in 1999\u20132000 is typical of that in other cold early winters. Despite unusually low temperatures, the lower stratospheric vortex developed more slowly than in previous unusually cold early winters, and was weaker than average until late Dec.\n\n==\n\nSeviour 2016:\n\nTitle: Stratospheric polar vortex splits and displacements in the high\u2010top CMIP5 climate models\n\nAbstract: Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events can occur as either a split or a displacement of the stratospheric polar vortex. Recent observational studies have come to different conclusions about the relative impacts of these two types of SSW upon surface climate. A clearer understanding of their tropospheric impact would be beneficial for medium\u2010range weather forecasts and could improve understanding of the physical mechanism for stratosphere\u2010troposphere coupling. Here we perform the first multimodel comparison of stratospheric polar vortex splits and displacements, analyzing 13 stratosphere\u2010resolving models from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) ensemble. We find a wide range of biases among models in both the mean state of the vortex and the frequency of vortex splits and displacements, although these biases are closely related. Consistent with observational results, almost all models show vortex splits to occur barotropically throughout the depth of the stratosphere, while vortex displacements are more baroclinic. Vortex splits show a slightly stronger North Atlantic surface signal in the month following onset. However, the most significant difference in the surface response is that vortex displacements show stronger negative pressure anomalies over Siberia. This region is shown to be colocated with differences in tropopause height, suggestive of a localized response to lower stratospheric potential vorticity anomalies.\n\n==\n\nWaugh 2013:\n\nTitle: Stratospheric Polar Vortices\n\nAbstract: The Stratosphere: Geophysical Mon Copyright 2010 b 10.1029/2009GM The intense cyclonic vortices that form over the winter pole are one of the most prominent features of the stratospheric circulation. The structure and dynamics of these \u201cpolar vortices\u201d play a dominant role in the winter and spring stratospheric circulation and are key to determining distribution of trace gases, in particular ozone, and the couplings between the stratosphere and troposphere.

The use of moments as an analysis tool gives rise to information about the vortex area, centroid latitude, aspect ratio, and kurtosis. The application of EVT to these moment-derived quantities allows the extreme variability of the vortex to be assessed. The data used for this study are 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) potential vorticity fields on interpolated isentropic surfaces that range from 450 to 1450 K.Analyses show that the most extreme vortex variability occurs most commonly in late January and early February, consistent with when most planetary wave driving from the troposphere is observed.

We analyzed the gut microbiome of 110 healthy individuals from two distinct locations (North-Central and Southern) in India using multi-omics approaches, including 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and metabolomic profiling of fecal and serum samples. Results The gene catalogue established in this study emphasizes the uniqueness of the Indian gut microbiome in comparison to other populations. The gut microbiome of the cohort from North-Central India, which was primarily consuming a plant-based diet, was found to be associated with Prevotella and also showed an enrichment of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathways. In contrast, the gut microbiome of the cohort from Southern India, which was consuming an omnivorous diet, showed associations with Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, and Faecalibacterium and had an enrichment of short chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and BCAA transporters. This corroborated well with the metabolomics results, which showed higher concentration of BCAAs in the serum metabolome of the North-Central cohort and an association with Prevotella. In contrast, the concentration of BCAAs was found to be higher in the fecal metabolome of the Southern-India cohort and showed a positive correlation with the higher abundance of BCAA transporters. Conclusions The study reveals the unique composition of the Indian gut microbiome, establishes the Indian gut microbial gene catalogue, and compares it with the gut microbiome of other populations. The functional associations revealed using metagenomic and metabolomic approaches provide novel insights on the gut-microbe-metabolic axis, which will be useful for future epidemiological and translational researches.\n\n==\n\nMitra 2013:\n\nTitle: Analysis of the intestinal microbiota using SOLiD 16S rRNA gene sequencing and SOLiD shotgun sequencing\n\nAbstract: BackgroundMetagenomics seeks to understand microbial communities and assemblages by DNA sequencing. Technological advances in next generation sequencing technologies are fuelling a rapid growth in the number and scope of projects aiming to analyze complex microbial environments such as marine, soil or the gut. Recent improvements in longer read lengths and paired-sequencing allow better resolution in profiling microbial communities. While both 454 sequencing and Illumina sequencing have been used in numerous metagenomic studies, SOLiD sequencing is not commonly used in this area, as it is believed to be more suitable in the context of reference-guided projects.ResultsTo investigate the performance of SOLiD sequencing in a metagenomic context, we compared taxonomic profiles of SOLiD mate-pair sequencing reads with Sanger paired reads and 454 single reads. All sequences were obtained from the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, which was amplified from microbial DNA extracted from a human fecal sample. Additionally, from the same fecal sample, complete genomic microbial DNA was extracted and shotgun sequenced using SOLiD sequencing to study the composition of the intestinal microbiota and the existing microbial metabolism. We found that the microbiota composition of 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained using Sanger, 454 and SOLiD sequencing provide results comparable to the result based on shotgun sequencing. Moreover, with SOLiD sequences we obtained more resolution down to the species level. In addition, the shotgun data allowed us to determine a functional profile using the databases SEED and KEGG.ConclusionsThis study shows that SOLiD mate-pair sequencing is a viable and cost-efficient option for analyzing a complex microbiome.

We compared the diversity of intestinal microbesamong a cohort of IBD patients to study the microbial ecological effects on IBD. Fecal samples from patients were sequenced with next generation sequence technology at 16S rDNA region. With statistical tools, microbial community was investigated at different level. The gut microbial diversity of Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) patients and colonic polyp (CP) patients significantly different from each other. However, the character of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients has of both CD and CP features. The microbial community from IBD patients can be very different (CD patient) or somewhat similar (UC patients) to non-IBD patients. Microbial diversity can be an important etiological factor for IBD clinical phenotype.\n\n==\n\nMalinen 2005:\n\nTitle: Analysis of the Fecal Microbiota of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients and Healthy Controls with Real-Time PCR\n\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE:The gut microbiota may contribute to the onset and maintenance of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In this study, the microbiotas of patients suffering from IBS were compared with a control group devoid of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms.METHODS:Fecal microbiota of patients (n = 27) fulfilling the Rome II criteria for IBS was compared with age- and gender-matched control subjects (n = 22). Fecal samples were obtained at 3 months intervals. Total bacterial DNA was analyzed by 20 quantitative real-time PCR assays covering approximately 300 bacterial species.RESULTS:Extensive individual variation was observed in the GI microbiota among both the IBS- and control groups. Sorting of the IBS patients according to the symptom subtypes (diarrhea, constipation, and alternating predominant type) revealed that lower amounts of Lactobacillus spp. were present in the samples of diarrhea predominant IBS patients wheras constipation predominant IBS patients carried increased amounts of Veillonella spp. Average results from three fecal samples suggested differences in the Clostridium coccoides subgroup and Bifidobacterium catenulatum group between IBS patients (n = 21) and controls (n = 15). Of the intestinal pathogens earlier associated with IBS, no indications of Helicobacter spp. or Clostridium difficile were found whereas one case of Campylobacter jejuni was identified by sequencing.CONCLUSIONS:With these real-time PCR assays, quantitative alterations in the GI microbiota of IBS patients were found. Increasing microbial DNA sequence information will further allow designing of new real-time PCR assays for a more extensive analysis of intestinal microbes in IBS.\n\n==\n\nAttri 2018:\n\nTitle: High throughput sequence profiling of gut microbiome in Northern Indian infants during the first four months and its global comparison\n\nAbstract: Abstract The present study characterized the colonization and development of gut microbial communities in healthy Indian infants from North-Western Himalayan region in the province Himachal Pradesh. The diversity and transitions of core genera was assessed targeting the 16S rRNA V3-V4 hypervariable region on an Illumina platform. Analysis of more than 17,000 filtered high quality reads indicated that the diversity was lowest in the month 2 followed by gradual increase towards month 4 (1.24 folds increase in Shannon index). The microbial population in month 1 was dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria followed by dominance of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes in the month 4. The analysis of aggregate microbiota at class level indicated relatively higher abundance of Clostridia, Bacteroides and Actinobacteria in month 1, 3 and 4, respectively. The global comparison of dominance of different phyla with the similar subjects indicated that the Indian microbiome is more similar with studies conducted with Swedish infants, although the differences in DNA extraction protocols, geographical location and sequencing platforms as confounding factors cannot be neglected. The findings in this small cohort study could facilitate future studies exploring various aspects of the human gut microbiome in Indian subcontinent.\n\n==\n\nSaulnier 2011:\n\nTitle: Gastrointestinal microbiome signatures of pediatric patients with irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND & AIMS\nThe intestinal microbiomes of healthy children and pediatric patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are not well defined. Studies in adults have indicated that the gastrointestinal microbiota could be involved in IBS.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed 71 samples from 22 children with IBS (pediatric Rome III criteria) and 22 healthy children, ages 7-12 years, by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, with an average of 54,287 reads/stool sample (average 454 read length = 503 bases). Data were analyzed using phylogenetic-based clustering (Unifrac), or an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) approach using a supervised machine learning tool (randomForest). Most samples were also hybridized to a microarray that can detect 8741 bacterial taxa (16S rRNA PhyloChip).\n\n\nRESULTS\nMicrobiomes associated with pediatric IBS were characterized by a significantly greater percentage of the class \u03b3-proteobacteria (0.07% vs 0.89% of total bacteria, respectively; P < .05); 1 prominent component of this group was Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Differences highlighted by 454 sequencing were confirmed by high-resolution PhyloChip analysis. Using supervised learning techniques, we were able to classify different subtypes of IBS with a success rate of 98.5%, using limited sets of discriminant bacterial species. A novel Ruminococcus-like microbe was associated with IBS, indicating the potential utility of microbe discovery for gastrointestinal disorders. A greater frequency of pain correlated with an increased abundance of several bacterial taxa from the genus Alistipes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUsing 16S metagenomics by PhyloChip DNA hybridization and deep 454 pyrosequencing, we associated specific microbiome signatures with pediatric IBS. These findings indicate the important association between gastrointestinal microbes and IBS in children; these approaches might be used in diagnosis of functional bowel disorders in pediatric patients.\n\n==\n\nZyoud 2021:\n\nTitle: Global research trends in the microbiome related to irritable bowel syndrome: A bibliometric and visualized study\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder. Dysregulation of the gut\u2013brain axis plays a central role in the pathophysiology of IBS. It is increasingly clear that the microbiome plays a key role in the development and normal functioning of the gut\u2013brain axis. AIM To facilitate the identification of specific areas of focus that may be of relevance to future research. This study represents a bibliometric analysis of the literature pertaining to the microbiome in IBS to understand the development of this field. METHODS The data used in our bibliometric analysis were retrieved from the Scopus database. The terms related to IBS and microbiome were searched in titles or abstracts within the period of 2000\u20132019. VOSviewer software was used for data visualization. RESULTS A total of 13055 documents related to IBS were retrieved at the global level. There were 1872 scientific publications focused on the microbiome in IBS. There was a strong positive correlation between publication productivity related to IBS in all fields and productivity related to the microbiome in IBS (r = 0.951, P < 0.001). The United States was the most prolific country with 449 (24%) publications, followed by the United Kingdom (n = 176, 9.4%), China (n = 154, 8.2%), and Italy (n = 151, 8.1%). The h-index for all retrieved publications related to the microbiome in IBS was 138. The hot topics were stratified into four clusters: (1) The gut\u2013brain axis related to IBS; (2) Clinical trials related to IBS and the microbiome; (3) Drug-mediated manipulation of the gut microbiome; and (4) The role of the altered composition of intestinal microbiota in IBS prevention. CONCLUSION This is the first study to evaluate and quantify global research productivity pertaining to the microbiome in IBS. The number of publications regarding the gut microbiota in IBS has continuously grown since 2013. This finding suggests that the future outlook for interventions targeting the gut microbiota in IBS remains promising.\n\n==\n\nKrogius-Kurikka 2009:\n\nTitle: Microbial community analysis reveals high level phylogenetic alterations in the overall gastrointestinal microbiota of diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome sufferers\n\nAbstract: BackgroundA growing amount of scientific evidence suggests that microbes are involved in the aetiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota of individuals suffering from diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) is distinguishable from other IBS-subtypes. In our study, the GI microbiota of IBS-D patients was evaluated and compared with healthy controls (HC) by using a high-resolution sequencing method. The method allowed microbial community analysis on all levels of microbial genomic guanine plus cytosine (G+C) content, including high G+C bacteria.MethodsThe collective faecal microbiota composition of ten IBS-D patients was analysed by examining sequences obtained using percent G+C (%G+C) -based profiling and fractioning combined with 16S rRNA gene clone library sequencing of 3267 clones. The IBS-D library was compared with an analogous healthy-control library of 23 subjects. Real-time PCR analysis was used to identify phylotypes belonging to the class Gammaproteobacteria and the order Coriobacteriales.ResultsSignificant differences were found between clone libraries of IBS-D patients and controls. The microbial communities of IBS-D patients were enriched in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, but reduced in the number of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes compared to control. In particular, 16S rDNA sequences belonging to the family Lachnospiraceae within the phylum Firmicutes were in greater abundance in the IBS-D clone library.ConclusionsIn the microbiota of IBS-D sufferers, notable differences were detected among the prominent bacterial phyla (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria) localized within the GI tract.", "final_summary": "The exploration of the gut microbiome in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) patients in India using Shotgun sequencing has been a focal point in several research studies. \n\nDhakan (2019) conducted a comprehensive study on the gut microbiome of healthy individuals in India.

The following three groups were studied: home cage (HC pregnant females remained in their home cage), Sham (females were placed in tanks similar to the SR group but with sawdust) and SR (females were submitted to the multiple platform method for 20 h per day from gestational days (GD) 14 to 20). Plasma corticosterone after 6 days of SR was not different among the groups. However, the relative adrenal weight was higher in the SR group compared with the HC group, which suggests possible stress impact. SR during pregnancy reduces the body weight of the female but no changes in liver glycogen, cholesterol and triglycerides, and muscle glycogen were detected. On GD 20, the fetuses of the females submitted to SR exhibited increased brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, which indicates that sleep restriction of mothers during the final week of gestation may affect neuronal growth factors in a fetal brain structure, in which active neurogenesis occurs during the deprivation period. However, no changes in the total reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cortex, hippocampus, or cerebellum of the fetuses were detected. SR females showed no major change in the maternal behavior, and the pups' preference for the mother's odor on postpartum day (PPD) 7 was not altered. On GD 20, the SR females exhibited increased plasma prolactin (PRL) and oxytocin (OT) compared with the HC and Sham groups. The negative outcomes of sleep restriction during delivery could be related, in part, to this hormonal imbalance. Sleep restriction during pregnancy induces different changes compared with the changes described in males and affects both the mother and offspring.\n\n==\n\nBrunton 2008:\n\nTitle: The expectant brain: adapting for motherhood\n\nAbstract: A successful pregnancy requires multiple adaptations of the mother's physiology to optimize fetal growth and development, to protect the fetus from adverse programming, to provide impetus for timely parturition and to ensure that adequate maternal care is provided after parturition. Many of these adaptations are organized by the mother's brain, predominantly through changes in neuroendocrine systems, and these changes are primarily driven by the hormones of pregnancy. By contrast, adaptations in the mother's brain during lactation are maintained by external stimuli from the young. The changes in pregnancy are not necessarily innocuous: they may predispose the mother to post-partum mood disorders.\n\n==\n\nBrunton 2015:\n\nTitle: Maternal Brain Adaptations in Pregnancy\n\nAbstract: During pregnancy multiple physiological adaptations take place in the mother to optimize the chances of a successful pregnancy outcome. These adaptations play a critical role in reproductive physiology, serving to (1) increase the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the placenta and maternal organs supporting the pregnancy; (2) optimize fetal growth and development; (3) prepare expanded oxytocin stores for when they are in demand at parturition and for lactation; (4) protect the pregnancy from premature birth; (5) protect the fetus from adverse programming, e.g., by maternal stress; (6) ensure adequate milk production and delivery at lactation; and (7) ensure that the appropriate brain circuits are primed and behaviors altered to deliver sufficient maternal care after parturition. In this chapter we focus on these pregnancy-related adaptations that are organized by the maternal brain, many of which are induced by the increased levels of pregnancy hormones.\n\n==\n\nPires 2020:\n\nTitle: Effects of sleep modulation during pregnancy in the mother and offspring: Evidences from preclinical research\n\nAbstract: Disturbed sleep during gestation may lead to adverse outcomes for both mother and child. Animal research plays an important role in providing insights into this research field by enabling ethical and methodological requirements that are not possible in humans. Here, we present an overview and discuss the main research findings related to the effects of prenatal sleep deprivation in animal models. Using systematic review approaches, we retrieved 42 articles dealing with some type of sleep alteration. The most frequent research topics in this context were maternal sleep deprivation, maternal behaviour, offspring behaviour, development of sleep\u2013wake cycles in the offspring, hippocampal neurodevelopment, pregnancy viability, renal physiology, hypertension and metabolism. This overview indicates that the number of basic studies in this field is growing, and provides biological plausibility to suggest that sleep disturbances might be detrimental to both mother and offspring by promoting increased risk at the behavioural, hormonal, electrophysiological, metabolic and epigenetic levels. More studies on the effects of maternal sleep deprivation are needed, in light of their major translational perspective.\n\n==\n\nChang 2010:\n\nTitle: Sleep deprivation during pregnancy and maternal and fetal outcomes: is there a relationship?\n\nAbstract: Sleep duration in the population has been declining. Women occupy an increasingly prominent place in the work force without reducing most of their responsibilities at home. Consequently, sleep needs are often pushed to the bottom of women's daily priority list. Prior research has indicated that sleep deprivation is associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory serum cytokines. This is important because higher plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory serum cytokine levels are associated with postpartum depression and adverse birth outcomes such as preterm delivery. However, little research has directly examined how sleep deprivation may affect maternal and fetal outcomes. This review summarizes the existing data on the effect of sleep deprivation during pregnancy on maternal and fetal outcomes. We review supporting evidence for the hypotheses that sleep deprivation during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm delivery and postpartum depression, and that systemic inflammation is the causal mechanism in the association. Prior research on sleep in pregnancy has been limited by varying data collection methods, subjective self-reported sleep measures, small and non-representative samples, cross-sectional designs; descriptive or non-hypothesis driven studies. Future research with longitudinal study designs is needed to allow examination of the effect of sleep deprivation on adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.\n\n==\n\nSlattery 2008:\n\nTitle: No stress please! Mechanisms of stress hyporesponsiveness of the maternal brain\n\nAbstract: The time around birth is accompanied by behavioural and physiological adaptations of the maternal brain, which ensure reproductive functions, maternal care and the survival of the offspring. In addition, profound neuroendocrine and neurobiological adaptations have been described with respect to behavioural and neuroendocrine stress responsiveness in rodents and human mothers. Thus, the hormonal response of the hypothalamo\u2010pituitary\u2010adrenal (HPA) axis and the response of the sympathetic nervous system to emotional and physical stressors are severely attenuated. Moreover, anxiety\u2010related behaviour and emotional responsiveness to stressful stimuli are reduced with the result of general calmness. These complex adaptations of the maternal brain are likely to be a consequence of an increased activity of brain systems with inhibitory effects on the HPA axis (such as the oxytocin and prolactin systems) and of a reduced activity of excitatory pathways (noradrenaline (norepinephrine), corticotrophin\u2010releasing factor and opioids). Experimental manipulation of these systems using complementary approaches indeed demonstrates their importance in these maternal brain adaptations. Maternal stress adaptations are not only important for the healthy prenatal development of the offspring by preventing excessive glucocorticoid responses and in the promotion of postnatal maternal behaviour, but are also vital for the well\u2010being of the mother and her mental health.\n\n==\n\nHedman 2002:\n\nTitle: Effects of pregnancy on mothers' sleep.\n\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES\nTo survey the effects of pregnancy on mothers' sleep.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMothers were interviewed during and after pregnancy with a series of five questionnaires to assess alterations in their sleep. The first questionnaire covered the 3 months before becoming pregnant, the next three the trimesters of pregnancy and the last the 3 months after delivery. The study was carried out in a central hospital and the maternity care units in the nearby rural community. Altogether, 325 pregnant women completed all five questionnaires.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe total amounts of reported sleep and of nocturnal sleep increased significantly during the first trimester of pregnancy, began to decrease thereafter and were shortest during the 3 months after pregnancy. During late pregnancy expectant mothers over 30 years of age reported less sleep than those under 30. During the whole pregnancy, but increasingly toward the end of pregnancy, sleep became more restless and fragmentary and its subjective quality worsened, due at least partly to increased restless legs and nightly awakenings increasing with advancing pregnancy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe subjective quality of sleep is disturbed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy, although total sleeping time increases. The amount of reported sleep begins to decrease in the second trimester. The frequency of reported sleep disturbances, such as restless legs syndrome and nocturnal awakenings, is maximum in the third trimester but is about normal within 3 months after delivery.\n\n==\n\nTikotzky 2009:\n\nTitle: Maternal sleep-related cognitions and infant sleep: a longitudinal study from pregnancy through the 1st year.\n\nAbstract: Infant sleep is a major source of concern for many parents. The aims of this longitudinal study were to assess: (a) the development of sleep patterns among infants, (b) the development of maternal cognitions regarding infant sleep, and (c) the relations between these domains during the 1st year of life. Eighty-five mothers were recruited during pregnancy and completed a questionnaire aimed at assessing maternal sleep-related cognitions. After delivery (at 1, 6, and 12 months) sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep logs, and maternal cognitions were reassessed. The findings demonstrated significant predictive and concomitant links between maternal cognitions and infant sleep. Maternal soothing behaviors mediated the relations between these domains.", "final_summary": "The intricate relationship between pregnancy and sleep deprivation has been the subject of numerous studies, revealing intriguing insights into how the maternal brain adapts to ensure both the mother's well-being and the optimal development of the fetus.\n\nPardo (2016) found that sleep restriction during pregnancy led to increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the fetuses' hippocampus, suggesting that maternal sleep deprivation may affect fetal brain development. Despite this, the study found no significant changes in maternal behavior or the pups' preference for the mother's odor, indicating that the maternal brain may adapt to cope with sleep deprivation.\n\nThis adaptive capacity of the maternal brain is further explored by Brunton (2008, 2015), who posits that the hormonal changes during pregnancy drive multiple physiological adaptations in the mother's brain. These adaptations optimize fetal growth and development, protect the fetus from adverse programming, and ensure adequate maternal care post-parturition. However, Brunton (2008) also warns that these changes may predispose the mother to post-partum mood disorders.\n\nPires (2020) and Chang (2010) both highlight the potential adverse outcomes of sleep deprivation during pregnancy for both the mother and the child, including behavioral, hormonal, electrophysiological, metabolic, and epigenetic risks. However, Chang (2010) also emphasizes the need for more research to directly examine the effect of sleep deprivation on maternal and fetal outcomes.\n\nSlattery (2008) provides a comprehensive overview of the neuroendocrine and neurobiological adaptations in the maternal brain during pregnancy, which result in reduced anxiety-related behavior and emotional responsiveness to stressful stimuli.

Tikotzky (2009) found significant predictive and concomitant links between maternal sleep-related cognitions and infant sleep, with maternal soothing behaviors mediating the relations between these domains.\n\nIn conclusion, the maternal brain undergoes significant adaptations during pregnancy to cope with sleep deprivation. These adaptations ensure the optimal development of the fetus and the well-being of the mother, but they may also predispose the mother to post-partum mood disorders.

A key reason is professionals in the field may not pay enough attention to students\u2019 overwhelmed cognitive capacity. Cognitive load theory explains that all humans have limited capacity at any given time to use their auditory, visual, and tactile inputs (independently or collectively) to acquire new information and store it in long-term memory. When available cognition is overwhelmed \u2013 which can be caused by any number of reasons \u2013 learning cannot occur.

Evolutionary psychology is used to assume that knowledge should be divided into biologically primary information that we have specifically evolved to acquire and biologically secondary information that we have not specifically evolved to acquire. Primary knowledge frequently consists of generic-cognitive skills that are important to human survival and cannot be taught because they are acquired unconsciously while secondary knowledge is usually domain-specific in nature and requires explicit instruction in education and training contexts. Secondary knowledge is first processed by a limited capacity, limited duration working memory before being permanently stored in long-term memory from where unlimited amounts of information can be transferred back to working memory to govern action appropriate for the environment. The theory uses this cognitive architecture to design instructional procedures largely relevant to complex information that requires a reduction in working memory load. Many of those instructional procedures can be most readily used with the assistance of educational technology.\n\n==\n\nCooper 1990:\n\nTitle: Cognitive load theory as an aid for instructional design\n\nAbstract: This paper attempts to draw together several recent findings in educational psychology that have led to the development and application of cognitive load theory to the format of instruction (Chandler and Sweller, unpublished manuscript; Sweller, 1988). These findings are directly related to the processes involved in learning, and will ultimately affect the way instructional design is approached. Cognitive load may be viewed as the level of 'mental energy' required to process a given amount of information. As the amount of information to be processed increases, so too does the associated cognitive load. Cognitive load theory suggests that effective instructional material promotes learning by directing cognitive resources towards activities that are relevant to learning rather than to processes that are an adjunct to learning. Cognitive load theory grew out of research investigating the differences between experts and novices. This research will be discussed briefly before returning to the issue of cognitive load theory.\n\n==\n\nMoreno 2010:\n\nTitle: Cognitive Load Theory: Cognitive Load Theory: Historical Development and Relation to Other Theories\n\nAbstract: The goal of this introductory chapter is to provide a historical review of the assumptions underlying Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and to place the theory into the broader context of the learning sciences. The chapter focuses on the theoretical developments that guided the research on cognitive load and learning for the past twenty years and is organized in the following way. First, we examine the nature of the cognitive load construct and compare it to similar psychological constructs. Second, we present a historical review of the development of CLT's assumptions in the following four stages: (a) extraneous cognitive load in problem solving, (b) intrinsic cognitive load and the first additivity hypothesis, (c) germane cognitive load and the second additivity hypothesis, and (d) the evolutionary interpretation of CLT. Finally, we conclude the chapter by examining the constructs and assumptions of CLT in relation to other theories in psychology and education. THE COGNITIVE LOAD CONSTRUCT CLT is a psychological theory because it attempts to explain psychological or behavioral phenomena resulting from instruction. Psychological theories are concerned with the possible relationships among psychological constructs or between a psychological construct and an observable phenomenon of practical consequence. A psychological construct is an attribute or skill that happens in the human brain. In CLT, the main constructs of interest are cognitive load , hence the name of the theory, and learning . CLT was developed to explain the effects of instructional design on these two constructs.", "final_summary": "Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) is a central concept in educational psychology, focusing on the limitations of working memory and the optimization of learning environments (Jong 2010; Springer 2010). In the context of prekindergarten education, the application of CLT can be both challenging and rewarding.\n\nMeissner (2013) applied CLT in an out-of-school science lesson, demonstrating that student clusters based on pre-knowledge and learning success could be identified. This suggests that CLT can provide guidelines for instructional design, even in heuristic science education. However, the study also highlighted the need for further refinement, particularly in relation to student motivation.\n\nMoos (2014) used CLT to explain the challenges faced by student teachers, revealing that cognitive overload can limit the ability to make modifications during teaching. This study underscores the importance of awareness and management of cognitive load in the teaching process, particularly in meeting the needs of diverse learners.\n\nKennedy (2021) reintroduced CLT in the context of special and general education, emphasizing the need to shape instruction to support students' unique needs. This study suggests that understanding and applying CLT can help address the cognitive challenges faced by students with disabilities.\n\nSweller (2019) discussed the role of educational technology in applying CLT, suggesting that instructional procedures designed to reduce working memory load can be effectively implemented with the aid of technology. This highlights the potential of technology in optimizing the application of CLT in prekindergarten education.\n\nCooper (1990) discussed the development and application of cognitive load theory to instructional design, but there is no specific mention of a historical perspective or the differences between experts and novices. Moreno (2010) provides a historical review of the assumptions underlying cognitive load theory and its relation to other theories in psychology and education, but there is no specific mention of the differences between experts and novices.\n\nIn conclusion, the application of CLT in prekindergarten education is a complex but promising endeavor. It requires a nuanced understanding of cognitive load, careful instructional design, and the effective use of educational technology. Further research is needed to refine the application of CLT in this context, particularly in relation to diverse learners and those with special needs (Meissner 2013; Moos 2014; Kennedy 2021; Sweller 2019; Cooper 1990; Moreno 2010)."}, {"query": "What are the competitive dynamics of a mid sized company in government contracting", "paper_list_string": "Stumpf 2000:\n\nTitle: Competitive pressures on middle\u2010market contractors in the UK\n\nAbstract: Medium\u2010sized regional building contractors in the UK are exhibiting poorer performance in the 1980s and the 1990s and are less likely to survive than their larger or smaller counterparts.

To obtain exogenous variation in firms\u2019 social engagement, I exploit a quasi\u2010natural experiment provided by the enactment of state\u2010level constituency statutes, which allow directors to consider stakeholders\u2019 interests when making business decisions. Using constituency statutes as instrumental variable (IV) for CSR, I find that companies with higher CSR receive more procurement contracts. The effect is stronger for more complex contracts and in the early years of the government\u2010company relationship, suggesting that CSR helps mitigate information asymmetries by signaling trustworthiness. Moreover, the effect is stronger in competitive industries, indicating that CSR can serve as a differentiation strategy to compete against other bidders.

The stated purpose of using competitive contracting is to forge formal, effective, and accountable collaborative relations. By applying institutional, transaction cost, and resource dependence theories to China's context, we reveal the institutional pressures of adopting a competitive contracting policy and identify the challenges of economizing transaction costs and handling mutual resource dependence in its implementation. We find the prevalence of \u201cdecoupling\u201d to meet these competing pressures at the sacrifice of competition: that is, many contracts only appear competitive. We conducted interviews, participant observations, and a questionnaire survey to study a large-scale, social-service-contracting program in Shanghai. The results provide evidence of weak competition.

Competition among contractors is theorized to drive down costs, encourage innovation, and boost accountability. However, there have been few studies on whether competition actually leads to improved performance among contractors. This analysis examines nearly 25,000 federal contracts to determine how competition is related to performance. Findings indicate that competitively sourced contracts are more likely to suffer from performance problems. However, relationships between contractor and agency correlate with fewer performance problems. This suggests that competition may not be leading to the benefits that many might expect. Instead, relationships and shared experiences, along with other factors, may matter more when seeking to improve contractor performance.", "final_summary": "The competitive dynamics of mid-sized companies in government contracting are multifaceted and influenced by various factors.

Although tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines have been found to be efficacious in patients with GAD, tolerability problems and other risks limit their use in clinical practice. In placebo-controlled, acute (<8\u2009weeks) trials, several medications, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ([SSRIs] escitalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline) and others (venlafaxine, buspirone, pregabalin), have demonstrated efficacy in patients with GAD. Indeed, current guidelines for the treatment of GAD recommend SSRIs as first-line pharmacological therapy because of their efficacy and tolerability profiles. Although GAD is a chronic condition that is usually present for years, with symptoms typically fluctuating in intensity over time, there have been few randomized, controlled trials of pharmacotherapy beyond the acute phase of treatment. However, data from recent relapse-prevention studies and longer-term maintenance studies with paroxetine, venlafaxine and escitalopram strongly support the value of continued treatment for at least a further 6 months. This article focuses on pharmacological treatment, and reviews recently available data from acute, long-term and relapse-prevention trials in patients with GAD.

As by definition it is a disorder progressing over months, treatment should be designed on a long term basis. And yet, few studies have been conducted beyond the classical 6\u20138 weeks characterizing the acute treatment phase. This is especially true of anxiolytics, but also of antidepressants, with the exception of paroxetine and venlafaxine, which are the only drugs approved in this indication in Western countries. The efficacy of psychotherapy, notably relaxation and cognitive-behavioral therapy, is established in the treatment of GAD, but its preferred indications and possible combination with antidepressants are still to be specified. Long term, not to say very long term studies of GAD, as well as depression, will still be required in the future to improve its management and specify therapeutic modalities (combination treatment, optimal duration, continuous or intermittent therapy, choice of psychotherapeutic techniques or agents, \u2026). Early and adequately prolonged treatment should not only result in more numerous remission periods, but also in decreased frequency of co-morbidities whether depressive, addictive, or of another nature, and should also reduce the social impact of GAD.\n\n==\n\nMah\u00e9 2000:\n\nTitle: Long\u2010term pharmacological treatment of generalized anxiety disorder\n\nAbstract: &NA; Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders and has a poor prognosis, although it is often thought to be a minor complaint. This disorder has a chronic course of 5\u201015 years and longer. Long\u2010term treatment with the commonly used benzodiazepines is controversial because of concerns over tolerance and dependence. We performed a thorough search of the literature for clinical trials of a duration of over 2 months conducted in patients with generalized anxiety disorder in order to identify any successful long\u2010term treatment of this disorder. Only eight long\u2010term reports of studies conducted in well\u2010defined homogeneous groups of patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder were found with the methodology of these studies presenting a number of limiting factors.

All venlafaxine XR patients still in the study at 12 months were randomized to receive venlafaxine XR or placebo, and all placebo patients continued taking placebo for another 6 months.\n\n\nSETTING\nOne urban site (5 locations).\n\n\nPATIENTS\nOf 268 patients with a diagnosis of GAD entering the open-label venlafaxine XR treatment phase, 158 (59.0%) completed 6 months, and 136 (50.7%) entered relapse phase 2 (6-12 months). Fifty-nine (43.4%) of 136 patients entered phase 3 (12-18 months).\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nSix months' open-label treatment with venlafaxine XR, followed by double-blind venlafaxine XR or placebo for 2 relapse phases, each lasting 6 months.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nTime to relapse while receiving venlafaxine XR or placebo after 6 and after 12 months of treatment. Relapse was strictly defined to safeguard against assigning patients with venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms or temporary anxiety increase as relapse.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor objective 1, relapse rates in phase 2 (months 6-12) were 9.8% on venlafaxine XR and 53.7% on placebo (P < .001). For objective 2, relapse rates after 12 months on placebo (32.4%) were lower than after 6 months on venlafaxine XR (53.7%) (P < .03).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment of GAD with an antidepressant should be continued for at least 12 months. Preliminary data demonstrate that improved patients who relapse while off their antianxiety medication after at least 6 months of treatment will again most likely respond to a second course of treatment with the same medication.

Three randomized controlled trials recently evaluated the safety and efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe trial designs were virtually identical, allowing data to be pooled across studies. Male and female outpatients, ages 18-80 years, with DSM-IV-defined GAD were randomized to double-blind treatment with escitalopram or placebo for 8 weeks. Escitalopram dose was fixed at 10 mg/day for the first 4 weeks, after which increases to 20 mg/day were permitted. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in total Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score.\n\n\nRESULTS\nApproximately 850 patients were randomized to double-blind treatment. In each individual study, escitalopram was significantly superior to placebo (p<0.05) as measured by change from baseline in HAMA score. By-visit analyses of data pooled across studies revealed significantly greater improvement (p<0.05) in the escitalopram group beginning at week 1 or 2 and continuing through week 8 for all primary and secondary efficacy variables. The mean change in HAMA total score from baseline to endpoint also was significantly greater for patients maintained at escitalopram 10 mg/day than for those receiving placebo. Escitalopram was generally well tolerated.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nThe studies included in this analysis were of short-term duration and excluded patients with significant medical and psychiatric comorbidities, such as major depressive disorder.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nResults from the individual trials and the pooled analysis demonstrate that escitalopram is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of GAD.\n\n==\n\nBarlow 1992:\n\nTitle: Behavioral treatment of generalized anxiety disorder\n\nAbstract: Sixty-five carefully diagnosed patients with generalized anxiety disorder were treated with either relaxation, cognitive therapy, or their combination. These three active treatment conditions were compared to a wait-list control group. On several measures, in-cluding measures of worry, treated patients were significantly better than those in the wait-list control group at post treatment. These gains were maintained across the two-year follow-up period. Notably, these therapeutic gains were accompanied by substantial reductions in anxiolytic medication use over the period of follow-up. No differences emerged, however, among treatments at any point of comparison. In addition, drop-out rates among the active treatment groups were high (range = 5% to 38%). Moreover, most patients were left with residual anxiety suggesting the need for the development of more focused and efficient psychological treatments for generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n==\n\nKeller 2002:\n\nTitle: The long-term clinical course of generalized anxiety disorder.\n\nAbstract: Although generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common disorder associated with significant levels of morbidity, little is known of its long-term course and outcomes. During the first 5 years, GAD follows a chronic course with low rates of remission and moderate rates of relapse/recurrence following remission. Retrospective studies suggest that this chronic pattern may last up to 20 years. It is hoped that, as with depression, long-term prospective studies in GAD will provide insight into the course, nature, and outcomes of the disorder over time. The studies will also identify any changes in the duration and severity of episodes of GAD over time, enabling treatments to effectively reflect the course of the disorder. Studies of other anxiety disorders and depression suggest that the course and outcome of the disorder may be influenced by certain factors such as stressful life events, anxiety sensitivity/negative affect, gender, subsyndromal symptoms, and comorbid disorders. Currently, studies are underway to determine the effects of these factors on the risk of relapse/recurrence, maintenance of full symptoms, and development of subsyndromal symptoms in GAD. GAD is currently underrecognized and undertreated, but it is hoped that this will change with the ever-increasing awareness of anxiety disorders. As treatment for GAD becomes more common, future prospective studies will identify the effect of therapy on the course and nature of the disorder, leading to increased understanding of GAD and the development of effective treatment strategies tailored for individual patients.\n\n==\n\nKessler 2005:\n\nTitle: Rethinking the duration requirement for generalized anxiety disorder: evidence from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication\n\nAbstract: Background. The proposed revisions of the ICD and DSM diagnostic systems have led to increased interest in evaluation of diagnostic criteria. This report focuses on the DSM-IV requirement that episodes of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) must persist for at least 6 months. Community epidemiological data are used to study the implications of changing this requirement in the range 1\u201312 months for estimates of prevalence, onset, course, impairment, co-morbidity, associations with parental GAD, and sociodemographic correlates. Method. Data come from the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), a US household survey carried out during 2001\u20132003. Version 3.0 of the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI) was used to assess DSM-IV anxiety disorders, mood disorders, substance disorders, and impulse-control disorders. Results. Lifetime, 12-month, and 30-day prevalence estimates of DSM-IV GAD changed from 6\u00b71%, 2\u00b79%, and 1\u00b78% to 4\u00b72\u201312\u00b77%, 2\u00b72\u20135\u00b75%, and 1\u00b76\u20132\u00b76% when the duration requirement was changed from 6 months to 1\u201312 months. Cases with episodes of 1\u20135 months did not differ greatly from those with episodes of [ges ]6 months in onset, persistence, impairment, co-morbidity, parental GAD, or sociodemographic correlates. Conclusions. A large number of people suffer from a GAD-like syndrome with episodes of <6 months duration. Little basis for excluding these people from a diagnosis is found in the associations examined here.", "final_summary": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a chronic condition that necessitates long-term treatment, but the exact duration varies. Lam (2006) underscores the chronic nature of GAD and suggests that treatment should be continued for at least six months, a conclusion supported by data from relapse-prevention studies. However, the need for more research into long-term treatment strategies is evident, as highlighted by Mah\u00e9 (2000) and Barlow (1992). Mah\u00e9 (2000) notes the absence of a reference drug for long-term treatment, while Barlow (1992) advocates for the development of more focused and efficient psychological treatments for GAD.\n\nRickels (2010) provides evidence that treatment with an antidepressant should be continued for at least 12 months. Goodman (2005) found that escitalopram was effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of GAD over an 8-week period, but the study does not explicitly suggest that longer-term treatment could be beneficial.\n\nKeller (2002) discusses the long-term clinical course of GAD, suggesting that GAD follows a chronic course with low rates of remission and moderate rates of relapse/recurrence. Kessler (2005), however, presents a different perspective, suggesting that a large number of people suffer from a GAD-like syndrome with episodes of less than 6 months duration.\n\nIn conclusion, while the exact duration of medication treatment for GAD varies, the consensus from the collected papers suggests that it is a chronic condition that requires long-term treatment.

Research suggests that members of GLBTIQ communities may face significant levels of abuse, harassment and violence (Leonard, Mitchell, Pitts, Patel, & Fox, 2008; NSW Attorney General\u2019s Department [NSW AGD], 2003). Experiencing sexual or physical violence, or other forms of abuse and victimisation, is often associated with a range of negative health and social outcomes\u2014such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse (Ryan & Rivers, 2003). However, it should also be recognised that members of GLBTIQ communities show great resilience in the face of social exclusion, discrimination and abuse (Scourfield, Roen, & McDermott, 2008).\n\n==\n\nHerek 1993:\n\nTitle: Documenting prejudice against lesbians and gay men on campus: the Yale Sexual Orientation Survey.\n\nAbstract: College and university communities recently have begun to confront the problems of harassment, discrimination, and violence against lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people on campus. A first step in responding to attacks against gay and bisexual people is to document their frequency and the forms that they take. The present article reports the methodology and results of a survey conducted at Yale University in 1986, which subsequently has been replicated on several other campuses. The Yale survey revealed that many lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people on campus lived in a world of secretiveness and fear. Although experiences of physical assault on campus were relatively infrequent, many respondents reported other forms of discrimination and harassment. A majority reported that they feared antigay violence and harassment on campus, and that such fears affected their behavior. Replications on other campuses have yielded similar results. Suggestions are offered for researchers who wish to conduct such a survey on their own campus.\n\n==\n\nHuebner 2004:\n\nTitle: Experiences of harassment, discrimination, and physical violence among young gay and bisexual men.\n\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES\nWe examined the 6-month cumulative incidence of anti-gay harassment, discrimination, and violence among young gay/bisexual men and documented their associations with mental health.\n\n\nMETHODS\nGay/bisexual men from 3 cities in the southwestern United States completed self-administered questionnaires.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-seven percent of men reported experiencing anti-gay verbal harassment in the previous 6 months; 11.2% reported discrimination, and 4.8% reported physical violence. Men were more likely to report these experiences if they were younger, were more open in disclosing their sexual orientation to others, and were HIV positive. Reports of mistreatment were associated with lower self-esteem and increased suicidal ideation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAbsent policies preventing anti-gay mistreatment, empowerment and community-building programs are needed for young gay/bisexual men to both create safe social settings and help them cope with the psychological effects of these events.\n\n==\n\nRabelo 2014:\n\nTitle: Two sides of the same coin: gender harassment and heterosexist harassment in LGBQ work lives.\n\nAbstract: This project investigated the incidence, interplay, and impact of gender- and sexuality-based harassment, as experienced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) employees in higher education. Unlike much queer empirical research, participants in this study were residents of noncoastal regions of the U.S. that are predominantly White, rural, and conservative (i.e., \"red states\"). They completed surveys about their harassment experiences (gender harassment-sexist, gender harassment-policing, and heterosexist harassment), perceived support systems (from supervisors and organizations), and job attitudes (job burnout, job stress, and job satisfaction). Results showed that gender harassment-both sexist and policing subtypes-rarely occurred absent heterosexist harassment, and vice versa. Harassment severity (experiencing moderate to high levels of all three harassment types) was significantly associated with greater levels of job burnout (both disengagement and exhaustion) and job dissatisfaction. Even infrequent experiences of harassment related to large increases in the \"threat\" variety of job stress (i.e., sense of feeling hassled and overwhelmed on the job). Additionally, employees who perceived the lowest organizational support reported the most harassment. We interpret results in light of research on organizational behavior and LGBQ psychology. Moreover, we discuss our findings in the context of Title VII, currently interpreted to protect against harassment based on gender, sex, and sex stereotyping, but not sexual orientation. Our results can inform several possible avenues of expanding gay civil rights in employment: broadening judicial interpretations of Title VII, passing new legislation (e.g., the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA), and strengthening organizational supports and policies that protect against sexuality-based abuses.\n\n==\n\nD\u2019augelli 1992:\n\nTitle: Lesbian and Gay Male Undergraduates' Experiences of Harassment and Fear on Campus\n\nAbstract: Harassment and discrimination based on sexual orientation was studied in a sample of 121 undergraduate students between 19 and 22 years of age. Over three fourths of the respondents reported verbal abuse and over one fourth had been threatened with violence. Other students were the most frequent victimizers.

In contrast to the narratives almost universally reported in academic literature, anti-gay victimisation and harassment were not experienced or framed as dominant discourses in the stories of the six participants. I discuss how despite heterosexuality being the assumed, expected and compulsory discourse at university, the participants made positive sense of their experiences, and how through careful negotiation they were able to address, explore and engage with their (homo)sexual identities and orientation. I challenge the common and (mostly) unquestioned practices of defining gay students solely on the basis of their negative accounts of their experiences, labelling them all as victims, and locating the entire population within a pathologised framework. Instead I advocate a nuanced and balanced perspective which acknowledges the alternate and non-victimised accounts of gay students to provide a more inclusive, comprehensive, fuller and richer understanding of their lived experiences at university.\n\n==\n\nD'Augelli 1989:\n\nTitle: Lesbians' and gay men's experiences of discrimination and harassment in a university community\n\nAbstract: A survey of 125 lesbians and gay men in a university community was conducted to determine the incidence of discrimination, harassment, and violence. Nearly three fourths had experienced verbal abuse; 26% were threatened with violence; and 17% had personal property damaged. Students and roommates were most often those responsible. Most incidents were not reported to authorities, and many made changes in their daily routines to avoid harm. Over half of the sample feared for their personal safety; their fear was related to the amount of harassment and previous property damage.

In exploring the above experiences of lesbians it becomes apparent that lesbians are the victims of a specific form of prejudice\u2013homophobia. Homophobia impacts lesbians in two ways: (1) in the form of negative attitudes and denigrating or destructive acts; and (2) by means of actual discrimination, whether overt or subtle.

Based on cognitive load theory (CLT), effective learning from dynamic visualizations requires the alignment of instructional conditions with the cognitive architecture of learners and their levels of expertise. By improving the effectiveness and efficiency of dynamic visualizations, students will be able to be more successful in retaining visual information that mediates their understanding of complex and difficult aspects of anatomy.

Such performance-based measures have proved to be useful in their own right. There are some situations, however, where the performance measures alone may not be sensitive enough to detect differences. This limitation can be seen from the fact that the graph viewer may achieve the same level of performance by devoting different amounts of cognitive effort. In addition, it is not often that individual performance measures are consistently in favor of a particular visualization. This makes design and evaluation difficult in choosing one visualization over another. In an attempt to overcome the above-mentioned limitations, we measure the effectiveness of graph visualizations from a cognitive load perspective. Human memory as an information processing system and recent results from cognitive load research are reviewed first. The construct of cognitive load in the context of graph visualization is proposed and discussed. A model of user task performance, mental effort and cognitive load is proposed thereafter to further reveal the interacting relations between these three concepts. A cognitive load measure called mental effort is introduced and this measure is further combined with traditional performance measures into a single multi-dimensional measure called visualization efficiency. The proposed model and measurements are tested in a user study for validity.

Both can be engaging and fun for university students in the fields of health and natural sciences. However, engagement by itself is not always conducive to learning. Consequently, teachers, lecturers, and instructional designers need to utilize the cognitive processing advantages of visualizations as well as engagement to achieve full instructional effectiveness. A cognitive processing focus has outlined many ways in which instructional visualization can be optimized. Specifically, cognitive load theory and the cognitive theory of multimedia learning are two research paradigms that provide several methods for directing the design of visualizations by considering how learners process visuospatial information. In this chapter, we describe five methods based on these cognitive theories: (a) the split attention effect and spatial contiguity principle, (b) the modality effect, (c) the redundancy effect and coherence principle, (d) the signaling principle, and (e) the transient information effect. For each of these effects, examples of applications for education in health and natural sciences are provided, where the influence of visuospatial processing is also considered.

Cognitive load theory assumes that the bottleneck for acquiring new secondary biological knowledge is the limited working memory capacity. In the ideal situation, the working memory resources required for learning do not exceed the available resources. Despite this, in reality, there will often be a high cognitive load, or even \u201doverload,\u201d for two reasons. First, dealing with interactive information elements in complex cognition imposes a high intrinsic working memory load. Second, learners also have to use working memory resources for activities that are extraneous to performing and learning tasks, that is, activities that are not productive for learning. Virtual Laboratory is a form of animation that can visualize abstract phenomena or complex experiments in natural laboratories to increase learning activities and develop problem-solving skills. A virtual math laboratory was created to optimize dual coding memory, namely verbal and audio learning. The investigation tracked the approved reporting Items for Systematics Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, illustrating the outcomes of the literature searches and articles selection process. It is used to provide that the selection process is replicable and transparent. We accomplished a computerized bibliometric analysis from 2002-2022 for articles retrieved from the SCOPUS database.

This paper presents instructional design considerations providing empirical evidence and integrating theoretical concepts related to cognitive load. Learners have a limited working memory, and instructional representations should be designed with the goal of reducing unnecessary cognitive load. However, cognitive architecture alone is not the only factor to be considered; individual differences, especially prior knowledge, are critical in determining what impact a visual representation will have on learners' cognitive structures and processes. Prior knowledge can determine the ease with which learners can perceive and interpret visual representations in working memory. Although a long tradition of research has compared experts and novices, more research is necessary to fully explore the expert\u2013novice continuum and maximize the potential of visual representations. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In order to explore the effects of the methodology on the students, a quantitative study was carried out to collect the students' perceptions through a questionnaire. A total of 163 students from the education degrees participated in the study: 65 from the Degree in Primary Education, 61 from the Degree in Early Childhood Education and 37 from the Degree in Social Education. The results show an increase in creativity, along with other dimensions analyzed, in the development of creative digital projects after the Design Thinking process. Therefore, it is concluded that it is interesting to introduce this creative process in teacher training as a preparation for the future educational challenges they will have to face.\n\n==\n\nArtym 2016:\n\nTitle: Pre-Service Teachers Designing and Constructing \"Good Digital Games\".\n\nAbstract: There is a growing interest in the application of digital games to enhance learning across many educational levels. This paper investigates pre-service teachers\u2019 ability to operationalize the learning principles that are considered part of a good digital game (Gee, 2007) by designing digital games in Scratch. Forty pre-service teachers, enrolled in an optional educational technology course, designed and constructed their own digital games in an authentic learning context. The course was structured to prepare pre-service teachers to use game design and construction in their future pedagogical practice. These pre-service teachers had various levels of game-playing experience, but little-to-no previous game-design/building experience. To evaluate the digital games, we created the Game Design Assessment Survey, which determined the degree to which a core set of learning principles, identified from the literature, were present in the digital games constructed by the pre-service teachers. Results suggested that pre-service teachers were generally unaware of the learning principles that should be included in the design of a good digital game, but were familiar with quality principles of interface usability. In addition, no relationship was found between the amount of time pre-service teachers played digital games and their ability to design and construct a good game.\n\n==\n\nFrossard 2015:\n\nTitle: Teachers Designing Learning Games\n\nAbstract: Abstract Creativity has become a key educational objective. How can game-based learning enhance creative pedagogies? This chapter proposes an approach in which teachers become game designers. It provides a model which analyzes creativity according to three dimensions: process, product, and teaching. We describe practical experiences in which teachers designed and applied their own learning games.

The analyses are based on video recordings of peer feedback activities within the context of a project on computational thinking using the software Scratch. Drawing on ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, the interactional and collaborative accomplishment of design critique is examined, focusing on how the participants make relevant norms and values concerning what constitutes a \u2018good\u2019 game. The results of the study show that the children and their teacher orient to different themes that concern aesthetic, functional, and ethical aspects of the games and the design process, at the same time as a moral order in and for the conduct of critique is accomplished in interaction. The study sheds light on the emergence of a local culture of critique as the children learn to formulate and respond to peer feedback, thus negotiating and developing digital literacy.", "final_summary": "Design thinking in teachers' development of digital educational games is a multifaceted process that involves creativity, understanding of learning principles, and iterative improvement. \n\nJan (2018) emphasizes the need for teachers to transition from content experts to learning experience designers, using games as a tool to develop 21st-century competencies in students. Similarly, Annetta (2019) highlights the transformative power of design thinking in changing how teachers approach teaching and learning design, particularly in the context of Serious Educational Games (SEGs).\n\nThe role of design thinking in fostering creativity in teacher training is underscored by Llorent-Vaquero (2022), who found that the use of Design Thinking in the development of digital educational projects increased creativity among education degree students. Frossard (2015) also supports this, suggesting that game design promotes teaching practices that foster students' creativity.\n\nHowever, the ability of teachers to operationalize learning principles in game design is not always straightforward.

The country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is increasing at a fast pace: from US$31 176 000 000 in 2000 to US$241 272 000 000 in 2018; and the country has experienced remarkable gains in combatting poverty and hunger. Gross National Income per capita has increased from US$110 in 2000 to US$2400 in 2018.1 At the moment the country is ranked in the low middle income countries by the world population review. Parallel with the economic growth, the country has experienced a fast and wide process of urbanisation. Over the past 20 years, more and more Vietnamese have moved from the rural areas to large urban areas with a projected urbanisation rate of 40% by early 2020. The rapid urbanisation has been accompanied by environment deterioration, increased air pollution, deterioration of lifestyle habits (including physical inactivity and diet changes) and a big strain in healthcare services.2\u20134 This remarkable financial success has been accompanied by a significant reduction in communicable diseases that have been substituted in the ranking of major causes of mortality and morbidity by non-communicable diseases (NCDs), as shown in figure 1. The burden of communicable diseases in Vietnam has significantly diminished from representing 38% and 33% of the morbidity and mortality burden in 1996 to a projected 18% and 6%, respectively, in 2026. The projected mortality burden of 6% for communicable diseases is significantly lower than the projected average burden for other countries in South East Asia (SEA). The successful efforts in combatting communicable diseases has been the main reason for the observed increase in life expectancy. The average life expectancy in Vietnam in 2017 was 79.2 years for women \u2026\n\n==\n\nTarp 2002:\n\nTitle: Trade and Income Growth in Vietnam: Estimates from a New Social Accounting Matrix\n\nAbstract: Economic reforms and greater outward orientation are giving rise to extensive structural change in the Vietnamese economy. Because of the leverage that global markets can exert on an emerging economy, such adjustments will be particularly significant in the composition of domestic supply and demand. As domestic protection levels are reduced and external market access increases, trade growth and shifting trade patterns will have pervasive effects on income distribution in Vietnam. In this paper, we use a newly estimated Vietnam social accounting matrix to elucidate the links between trade and income in the country. With matrix decomposition methods, we show how the Vietnamese economy propagates the direct effects of external demand across the spectrum of domestic activities, factors, and households. This detailed analysis provides a blueprint for policies to improve economic participation of activities and households with relatively weak linkages to the rest of the economy.\n\n==\n\nGlewwe 2004:\n\nTitle: Economic Growth, Poverty, and Household Welfare in Vietnam\n\nAbstract: Viet Nam is an economic success story - it transformed itself from a country in the 1980s as one of the poorest in the world, to a country in the 1990s with one of the world's highest growth rates. With the adoption of a new market-oriented policies, Viet Nam averaged an economic growth rate of 8 percent per year from 1990 to 2000, a growth rate accompanied by a large reduction in poverty, stemming from significant increases in school enrollment, and a rapid decrease in child malnutrition. The book uses an unusually rich set of macroeconomic, and household survey data, to examine several topics: the causes of the economic turnaround, and prospects for future growth; the impact of economic growth on household welfare, as measured by consumption expenditures, health, education, and other socioeconomic indicators; and, the nature of poverty in Viet Nam, and the effectiveness of government policies, intended to reduce same.

This paper represents the first attempt to measure the effect of Doi Moi on Vietnam's GDP. In the paper the level of GDP actually reached is compared with the level that would have been reached had the policy not been implemented, i.e. without the improvements in productivity and the increases in investment ratio that can be directly attributed to Doi Moi. Cross-time changes in GDP were depicted by a production function of capital stock, economically active labour force and technical progress. It was found that, after a time lag, Doi Moi appeared to have a significant positive effect on productivity, which by 1998 accounted for a 42% increase in GDP.\n\n==\n\nShultz 1994:\n\nTitle: Vietnam\n\nAbstract: Vietnam is an evolving political economy and marketing system. Since the implementation of Doi Moi, the 1986 policy to invoke a shift from central economic planning to a more market-oriented system, the country has made extraordinary progress on several socioeconomic indicators. Some observers contend Vietnam is a development model; others suggest the country still has numerous challenges to overcome before it can reach its development goals.

Although VSD provides helpful ways of thinking about and designing value-centered computational systems, we argue that the specific mechanics of VSD create thorny tensions with respect to value sensitivity. In particular, we examine limitations due to value classifications, inadequate guidance on empirical tools for design, and the ways in which the design process is ordered. In this paper, we propose ways of maturing the VSD methodology to overcome these limitations and present three empirical case studies that illustrate a family of methods to effectively engage local expressions of values.

The User Interface (UI) design is one of the concerns in HCI, being multidisciplinary, it ensures the user's satisfaction and perception of technology which follows during the development process. The VSD method takes human values in a comprehensive manner throughout three investigations called tripartite methodology, and the investigations applied as the techniques to investigate the requirements of the development from various stakeholders values. Since variations of stakeholders, VSD method follows the designers, direct and indirect stakeholders to take out required values into the development. In spite of the widely used VSD method undetermined the values that to be considered on design as designers, direct or indirect stakeholders. The argument considering the values has been researching since the concept applied to HCI design which indicates the method limitation. In this research considered two values, designers and stakeholders and the key concern to observe the effects and realism of the applications of VSD method into the design of user interface also reviewed earlier researches on the application of VSD.

Specifically, the purpose of the method is to expand and shape a co-design space so that stakeholders, acting as designers, focus not only on the form and function of a tool being envisioned but also on the social context of its use and values that lie with individuals, groups, and societies. The method introduces value sensitive stakeholder prompts and designer prompts into a co-design process, creating a particular kind of reflection-on-action cycle. The prompts provide a means for bringing empirical data on values and theoretical perspective into the co-design process. We present the method in terms of a general model, the Value Sensitive Action-Reflection Model; place the model within discourse on co-design spaces; and illustrate the model with a discussion of its application in a lo-fi prototyping activity around safety for homeless young people.

Previous studies using the TPB to explain teachers' intentions to use technology have resulted in inconsistent findings. This inconsistency might be due to overly broad definitions of the target behavior. To investigate this potential weakness, we defined a specific target behavior, using computers only to create and deliver lessons, and then used the TPB to investigate teachers' decisions. An elicitation study was used to identify teachers' salient beliefs and develop a closed-ended questionnaire. Results of the closed-ended questionnaire revealed that AB, SN, and PBC all were significant predictors of teachers' intentions. However, AB had twice the influence of SN and three times that of PBC. This finding suggests that teachers must have positive attitudes about using computers to create and deliver lessons. They are less concerned about what others think of this practice, and far less bothered by internal or external constraints. Results provide specific information that can be used to design effective teacher development programs and remind TPB researchers of the importance of using specific definitions of the target behavior.\n\n==\n\nMartin 2004:\n\nTitle: Self-Efficacy Theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior: Teaching Physically Active Physical Education Classes\n\nAbstract: Abstract The purpose of our investigation was to examine determinants of teachers' intentions to teach physically active physical education classes (i.e., spend at least 50% of class time with the students engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity). Based on the theory of planned behavior, a model was examined hypothesizing that teachers' intentions were determined by subjective norm, attitude, and perceived behavioral control. Grounded in self-efficacy theory, it was hypothesized that program goal importance and hierarchical and barrier self-efficacy would also predict intention. Using a series of hierarchical regression analyses, the theory of planned behavior was supported by accounting for 59% of the variance in intention due to attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm. Self-efficacy theory based variables received minimal support.\n\n==\n\nTeo 2016:\n\nTitle: Teachers and technology: development of an extended theory of planned behavior\n\nAbstract: Abstract\nThis study tests the validity of an extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to explain teachers\u2019 intention to use technology for teaching and learning. Five hundred and ninety two participants completed a survey questionnaire measuring their responses to eight constructs which form an extended TPB. Using structural equation modelling, the results showed that the constructs in the extended TPB were significant in explaining teachers\u2019 intention to use technology in their work. Among the constructs in the research model, attitude towards computer use had the largest positive influence on technology usage intention, followed by perceived behavioral control. However, subjective norm had a negative impact on intention. The inclusion of the antecedent variables had also strengthened the ability of the extended TPB model to explain intention. This study contributes to the growing discussions in applying psychological theories to explain behavioral intention in educational contexts.\n\n==\n\nDunn 2018:\n\nTitle: Using the Theory of Planned Behavior to explore teachers\u2019 intentions to engage in ongoing teacher professional learning\n\nAbstract: Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine the factors influencing teachers\u2019 intentions to engage in professional learning on the mathematics Common Core State Standards (CCSS). The aim was to identify specific factors teachers encounter that impinge upon or facilitates implementing new instructional practices. Ajzen\u2019s (1991) theory of planned behavior was used to examine the influence of three constructs (attitude toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control) on teachers\u2019 intentions to implement the instructional expectations associated with the CCSS in mathematics. Data for this quantitative study was collected from 152 teachers in an urban school district in California. The result of the study provides support for the adequacy of the theory of planned behavior for predicting and understanding teachers\u2019 behavioral intention toward professional learning. Intention was predicted significantly by perceived behavioral control, subjective norm and attitude toward the behavior.\n\n==\n\nMacFarlane 2013:\n\nTitle: Teacher attitudes and behavior toward the inclusion of children with social, emotional and behavioral difficulties in mainstream schools: An application of the theory of planned behavior\n\nAbstract: Abstract The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used to examine relationships between teacher attitudes and behavior toward children with social, emotional and behavioral difficulties (SEBD). One hundred and eleven elementary school teachers completed questionnaires. Teacher perception of their school principals' expectations (subjective norm) predicted teacher behaviors. Teachers who had attended more in-service training (INSET) sessions held more positive feelings, but teachers with more experience were less willing to work with children with SEBD. Findings suggest that school principals have a central role in promoting an inclusive ethos within their schools. INSET could focus more on challenging beliefs.\n\n==\n\nStanec 2009:\n\nTitle: The Theory of Planned Behavior: Predicting Teachers\u2019 Intentions and Behavior during Fitness Testing\n\nAbstract: The twofold purpose of this study was to develop and validate an instrument that assessed teachers\u2019 intentions, attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavior control to administer fitness tests effectively, and to determine how well the instrument could predict teachers\u2019 intentions and actual behavior based on Ajzen\u2019s (1985, 1991) theory of planned behavior. In the development phase of the study, 104 physical educators completed the pilot version of the survey to refine the instrument. In the prediction of behavior phase of the study, a convenience sample of 195 physical educators completed (a) the Teachers\u2019 Intentions to Administer Physical Fitness Tests Effectively (TIAPFTE) before fitness testing and (b) a behavior self-report after they administered fitness testing. Standard multiple regression analyses showed perceived behavioral control and attitude significantly predicted intention. Furthermore, results showed that attitude significantly predicted teachers\u2019 behavior directly.\n\n==\n\nCrawley 1990:\n\nTitle: Intentions of Science Teachers To Use Investigative Teaching Methods: A Test of the Theory of Planned Behavior.\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this study was to explore the utility of the theory of planned behavior for predicting the behavioral intentions of teachers enrolled in the Institute in Physical Science, an EESA, Title II program funded by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. In particular, the study investigated three determinants of teachers' behavioral intentions (BI) set forth in the theory of planned behavior, namely, attitude toward the behavior (AB), subjective norm (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC). The behavior of interest in this study was the intention of teachers in grades 5/6 or 9/10 who were enrolled in the Institute to use 50% of the activities and investigations completed in the program with students they would teach during the next school year. Data were collected from 50 elementary and secondary teachers. Simple and hierarchical regression analyses were used to determine the relative contributions of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control (and their interactions) to the prediction of behavioral intention. Results of this study indicated that attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control made significant contributions to the prediction of behavioral intention. Examination of the data blocked on external variables revealed attitude toward the behavior to be the single most important predictor of behavioral intention. Intent to perform the behavior appears to be totally under the control of most teachers, with little need for social support and with ample resources and sufficient opportunities available to perform the behavior.\n\n==\n\nKnauder 2019:\n\nTitle: Individualized student support in primary school teaching: A review of influencing factors using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)\n\nAbstract: Abstract According to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991), each behavior results from a behavioral intention, which in turn depends on attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. In this study, the TPB was investigated with respect to individualized student support and teachers' intrinsic and extrinsic support intentions involving 488 primary school teachers. Employing individualized support interventions was predicted directly by self-efficacy beliefs and the intrinsic support intention as well as indirectly by teachers\u2019 attitudes. More practically experienced teachers implement support measures more often, while multi-groupcomparisons regarding advanced training showed no differences in the tested model for the TPB.", "final_summary": "The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) has been widely used to understand teacher decisions across various educational contexts. The TPB posits that behavioral intention, which is a significant predictor of actual behavior, is influenced by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control (Lee, 2010; Martin, 2004; Teo, 2016; Dunn, 2018; MacFarlane, 2013; Stanec, 2009; Crawley, 1990; Knauder, 2019).\n\nIn the realm of educational technology, Lee (2010) found that teachers' attitudes towards using computers for lesson creation and delivery had the most significant influence on their intentions, overshadowing the impact of subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. Similarly, Teo (2016) found that teachers' attitudes towards computer use had the largest positive influence on their intention to use technology.\n\nWhen it comes to physical education, Martin (2004) found that the TPB could explain 59% of the variance in teachers' intentions to teach physically active classes. However, self-efficacy theory-based variables received minimal support. Stanec (2009) also found that teachers' attitudes and perceived behavioral control significantly predicted their intentions to administer fitness tests effectively.\n\nIn the context of professional learning, Dunn (2018) found that teachers' intentions to engage in professional learning were significantly predicted by perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, and attitude towards the behavior. Similarly, Crawley (1990) found that attitude towards the behavior was the single most important predictor of teachers' intentions to use investigative teaching methods.\n\nIn terms of inclusive education, MacFarlane (2013) found that teachers' perceptions of their school principals' expectations (subjective norm) predicted their behaviors towards children with social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties. Knauder (2019) found that employing individualized student support was directly predicted by self-efficacy beliefs and intrinsic support intention, and indirectly by teachers\u2019 attitudes.\n\nIn conclusion, the TPB provides a useful framework for understanding teacher decisions across various educational contexts. However, the relative importance of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control may vary depending on the specific context and behavior in question."}, {"query": "informal economy and environmental economy", "paper_list_string": "Elgin 2014:\n\nTitle: Pollution and Informal Economy\n\nAbstract: In this study, we investigate the relationship between the size of the informal economy and the level of environmental pollution/energy use. To this end, we first use different indicators of environmental pollution along with a measure of energy use intensity in a panel dataset consisting of 152 countries over the period 1999\u20132009 and empirically examine the relationship between pollution and the shadow economy. The estimation results show that there is an inverse-U relationship between the size of the informal economy and environmental pollution, that is, small and large sizes of the informal economy are associated with lower environmental pollution and medium levels of informality are associated with higher levels of environmental pollution. Next, we build a two sector dynamic general equilibrium model to suggest an economic mechanism for this observation. Our model identifies two channels through which informality might affect environmental pollution: The scale effect, whereby a larger (smaller) informal economy size is associated with a lower (higher) level of environmental pollution, and the deregulation effect, whereby a larger (smaller) informal economy is associated with higher (lower) pollution levels. As these two effects work in opposite directions, the changing relative strength of one with respect to the informal sector size creates the inverted-U relationship between pollution indicators and informality.\n\n==\n\nEren 2022:\n\nTitle: The moderating role of informal economy on financial development induced ekc hypothesis in turkey\n\nAbstract: This study conducts an empirical investigation about the moderating role of the informal economy on Turkey's environmental performance by employing advanced econometric techniques that account numerous structural breaks in series. In this extent, we created three interaction variables by captivating the impact of informal economic activities on CO2 emissions through income, energy use, and financial sector development. Besides, we built a main effect model without the interaction variables to assess the direct effects of our variables on global environmental degradation. The outcomes of the carried analyses produced supporting evidence toward the confirmation of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) assumption. Obtained findings shown that energy use, financial development and the informal economy in Turkey transmit a deteriorating impact on environmental well-being. Furthermore, the moderating role of the informal economy was found to be statistically significant factor in terms of both economic and environmental efficiency.\n\n==\n\nSmit 2015:\n\nTitle: Towards connecting green economy with informal economy in South Africa : a review and way forward\n\nAbstract: The informal economy is a vibrant and growing phenomenon, offering both opportunities and lessons on resilience and innovation. When considering global social, economic and environmental challenges, resilience and innovation are valuable response strategies. The notion of a green economy has similarly inspired a number of ideological, geopolitical and institutional responses, yet a review of the dominant approach indicates the propensity to undervalue or ignore the informal economy. Within the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, connecting the informal economy with the green economy is imperative. This paper explores possible connections between the green economy and the informal economy in South Africa and argues that by engaging the informal economy in discussions on the green economy, a more informed policy and planning environment may ensue, resulting in more socially equitable and environmentally sustainable development.\n\n==\n\nMazhar 2013:\n\nTitle: Environmental Regulation, Pollution and the Informal Economy\n\nAbstract: The regulation of environmental pollution is challenging. Particularly, the presence of institutional weaknesses like informal economy may not allow effective regulation. In this context, this paper addresses three related questions: (a) How stringent environmental regulation affects pollution? (b) What is the link between stringency of environmental regulation and the size of the informal economy? (c) How informal economy affects formal sector pollution? We use a data set of more than 100 countries from 2007 to 2010, a multivariate framework that controls for the influence of important factors and an index of perceived stringency of environmental regulation. The main findings of the paper, in line with theoretical reasoning, are that (i) stringent environmental regulation reduces pollution and (ii) stringent environmental regulation increases the size of the informal economy. This evidence suggests that informal economy helps avoid environmental regulation by being outside the regulatory sphere. An additional support to this finding is provided by the robust negative correlation between the size of the informal economy and the formal sector pollution. Our findings are based on interactive and non-linear effects that are tested and verified. In this regard, the paper raises new issues about possible mechanisms to reduce pollution in the presence of the informal economy.\n\n==\n\nPerera 1996:\n\nTitle: Accommodating the Informal Sector: A Strategy for Urban Environmental Management\n\nAbstract: Abstract Livelihoods of the urban poor, particularly the informal economic activities operating on streets and other public places, are usually seen as undesirable for environmental management by urban authorities which are preoccupied with keeping their cities clean. Hence, informal sector activities are often seen as \u00ab\u00abeye-sores\u00bb\u00bb and are evicted from city centers in the name of \u00ab\u00abpublic cleanliness and orderliness\u00bb\u00bb. However, it is seen that environmental problems associated with the informal sector are mostly manifestations of unresponsive physical planning systems rather than attributes inherent to the sector's respective activities. An environmental impact analysis shows that provision of proper business premises to informal enterprises is an effective measure to curb the environmental problems associated with the sector. From this viewpoint, accommodating the informal sector in the urban built-environment is seen as an effective strategy for urban environmental management.\n\n==\n\nGuibrunet 2017:\n\nTitle: The contribution of the informal economy to urban sustainability \u2013 case study of waste management in Tepito, Mexico City\n\nAbstract: This thesis explores the role of the informal economy in urban environmental management. Cities\u2019 relation with the environment is mediated by the urban infrastructure, which provides services such as transport or waste management. Beyond the implementation of plans by local governments, the daily operation of such infrastructure is also the result of informal work. Yet, little is known about the nature and impacts of informal work in urban service provision. This thesis tackles this research gap by documenting the everyday operation of domestic waste collection and management in a neighbourhood of Mexico City. The aim of this research is twofold. Firstly, it aims to critically analyse the concept of \u201cinformality\u201d in the case of urban waste management, and to document how informality operates in that context. Secondly, it assesses the contribution of the informal economy to the waste management system, by contrasting it to the key components of urban sustainability. The research presents primary data collected through qualitative fieldwork. Using an urban metabolism framework, it documents waste flows through the urban infrastructure, identifying the role of formal and informal waste handlers along the way. In parallel, it explores the normative discourses of informality that are mobilised in the production of Mexico City\u2019s urban sustainability policies. The thesis argues that it is necessary to re-consider the role of informal workers in urban sustainability. In Mexico City, informal and formal waste workers\u2019 relationship is symbiotic. Formal waste collection services are sustained by informal work and cash flows. In parallel, informal waste handlers provide the main input (recyclable materials) to the formal recycling industry \u2013 this is achieved through the reliance on local solidarity networks and techniques of experimentation and innovation which are characteristic of the informal economy. The informal economy appears to contribute positively to the environmental and social components of urban sustainability. Yet, informal workers are not recognised as legitimate actors in policy making. Instead, the concept of informality is mobilised by civil servants to exclude informal workers from the policy process. This challenges the potential for inclusive governance, a key component of urban sustainability.\n\n==\n\nRuzek 2014:\n\nTitle: The Informal Economy as a Catalyst for Sustainability\n\nAbstract: Sustainability typically involves the balancing of three major factors: the economy, the environment, and some notion of equity. Though the economy is already a key aspect, the recognition of the informal economy, seems to be absent from the many possible permutations of these three. This paper will explore the various aspects of the informal economy and how it can make a considerable impact on achieving a more sustainable future. Specifically, this paper focuses on how the informal economy can encourage the sustainable use of goods, while offering an alternative to the regulated market economy. By supporting the informal sectors such as farmers markets, street vendors and non-market activities, a shift away from a car-dominated society and singular economic trajectory can begin. The informal sector can provide, social capital, promote local economies, create jobs and provide the need economic shift toward a sustainable future.\n\n==\n\nKahn 2000:\n\nTitle: Informal Economies, Information and the Environment\n\nAbstract: \"If household and firm activities are not observable by government, then they may not be observable by those affected by environmental degradation either.... [W]e have a regulatory challenge: when information is scarce, private bargaining is unlikely to suffice ... and government will lack a basis for regulatory action.\" Many less developed countries (LDCs) contain sizeable shadow economies. For example, informal economic activity constitutes perhaps 70 percent of the GDP of Nigeria and Egypt, and perhaps as much as 30 percent of the GDP of Chile, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Brazil, Paraguay and Colombia.(1) The magnitude of the shadow economy in these and other countries may have serious environmental consequences. Environmental regulators seeking to provide incentives for environmental protection and conservation, for example, face enormous difficulties in monitoring and enforcing laws in the shadow sector. Groups and individuals operating in this sector recognize that they are not likely to be held accountable for actions that degrade environmental quality. The lack of accountability and incentives to comply with strong environmental standards raises the possibility that parties operating in the shadow sector will engage in activities that threaten the quality of the environment. This includes activities that cause an increase in the number of hazardous waste sites, the degradation of local air and water quality, species loss and total greenhouse gas emissions. While informal sectors exist in all economies, the impact of unobserved economic activity on the environment might be more intense in developing countries for at least four reasons: first, as suggested above, the shadow sectors of LDCs are likely to represent a higher proportion of gross GDP than in developed countries; second, LDCs characteristically have more relatively rural and unpopulated areas, in which the inhabitants lack sufficient incentives (economic or otherwise) to motivate well-defined property rights;(2) next, developing countries are poorer, and thus their governments have fewer resources with which to monitor polluters; and finally, if environmental health is understood as a \"luxury good\"(3) then developing countries may lack the motivation to develop institutions that expose shadow sectors to regulation. Given the challenge shadow economies pose to environmental regulators, are there strategies that a well-intentioned government can pursue to mitigate environmental damage? This paper will investigate three major related questions: 1. How does the existence of shadow sectors affect the design of environmental regulation? 2. How might regulators set environmental policies if they had more information concerning economic activity within shadow sectors? 3. Could economic development (including income growth) and increased international trade help \"lift the shadow\" and thus aid environmental regulators in pursuing accountability? In general, environmental economic policies should provide appropriate incentives for firms and households to reduce environmental degradation. Designed appropriately, such government intervention can guide markets toward outcomes that are socially preferable if, as expected, these actors ignore to some extent the environmental consequences of their actions. Appropriate intervention, however, may require expensive studies to gather useful information regarding actors in the shadow economy. Thus, regulators may choose not to gather this information. Consider the underlying policy problems: firms and households make millions of choices every day which go unobserved by regulators and may have an impact on the environment. These are choices such as: the quantity and type of fuel to use; or, whether to dump hazardous wastes or dispose of them properly If a regulator observed each activity and thereby knew how much damage was caused, they could provide appropriate incentives--facing polluters with the full costs of their activities. \u2026", "final_summary": "The relationship between the informal economy and environmental economy is a complex and multifaceted one, as evidenced by the diverse findings in the literature. \n\nElgin (2014) found an inverse-U relationship between the size of the informal economy and environmental pollution, suggesting that both small and large informal economies are associated with lower pollution levels.

It is conceivable that in the coming decades, humans may succeed in creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) that thinks and acts with an open-endedness and autonomy comparable to that of humans. The implications would be profound for our species; they are now widely debated not just in science fiction and speculative research agendas but increasingly in serious technical and policy conversations. Much work is underway to try to weave ethics into advancing ML research. We think it useful to add the lens of parenting to these efforts, and specifically radical, queer theories of parenting that consciously set out to nurture agents whose experiences, objectives and understanding of the world will necessarily be very different from their parents'. We propose a spectrum of principles which might underpin such an effort; some are relevant to current ML research, while others will become more important if AGI becomes more likely.

The inevitable presence of digital media has a major impact on parent\u2013child relationships and parenting skills. The increased use of digital devices, such as smartphones and tablets, by children forces the parents to change their parenting styles. Digital parenting refers to a process adopted by parents to monitor and regulate the activities of their young ones in handling digital devices. The main aim of this style is to protect their children from various online dangers. Parents need to use several approaches for regulating digital media behaviors of children, such as setting limits, practicing constructive discipline, spending time with their kids, and so forth. However, there are challenges associated with digital parenting. Some of the issues include unlimited access to Internet, parents\u2019 job, reverse socialization, and so on.

Children born in the age of technology, who shared their photos against their will from birth, do not hesitate to use technological devices and have the curiosity and ability to use multiple digital media at once. They use digital media and devices as creative, productive, and problem-solving tools. They need direction. Parents and teachers need skills and attitudes to help children use technology positively. Digital parenting and media guidance as new parent roles reflect this perspective. The digital parenting perspective says it's not true to keep kids away from media and devices by focusing on the negatives. Instead of focusing on the negative effects of technology, he suggests teaching children how to use digital media and tools to solve daily problems. The digital parenting approach seems more stimulating for children and adults. We need children who understand digital tools better than us in today's world, where problems can't be solved without technology. The research focused on the positive effects of technology on children in terms of \"being the parent of gifted children born in the digital age\" It allows them to use this content rationally to create new content and share it with new social connections.

Drawing on extensive research with parents both rich and poor, parenting toddlers to teenagers, this book reveals how digital technologies give parenting struggles a distinctive character, as parents determine how to forge new territory with little precedent, or support. It argues that, in late modernity, parents are both more burdened with responsibilities and yet increasingly charged with respecting and developing the agency of their child\u2014leaving much to be negotiated. The book charts how parents enact authority and values through digital technologies\u2014as \u201cscreen time,\u201d videogames, and social media become ways of both being together and of setting boundaries, with digital technologies introducing valued opportunities and new sources of risk. To light their way, parents comb through the hazy memories of their own childhoods and look toward hard-to-imagine futures. This results in deeply diverse parenting in the present, as parents move between embracing, resisting, or balancing the role of technology in their own and their children\u2019s lives. This book moves beyond the panicky headlines to offer a deeply researched exploration of what it means to parent in a period of significant social and technological change. Drawing on qualitative and quantitative research in the United Kingdom, the book offers conclusions and insights relevant to parents, policymakers, educators, and researchers everywhere.\n\n==\n\nLupton 2016:\n\nTitle: Parenting and Digital Media: From the Early Web to Contemporary Digital Society\n\nAbstract: Parents have accessed websites, online discussion forums and blogs for advice, information and support since the early days of the World Wide Web (which first became widely available to users in the mid-1990s). In this century, the advent of mobile media such as smartphones and tablet computers and Wi-Fi has allowed parents to access the web from almost any location. They can use social-media platforms and apps (software applications for mobile devices) as part of their parenting practices. These technologies have brought with them opportunities for parents to seek information and support and exchange details of their experiences with each other in a variety of ways. These practices contribute to datafication, that is, rendering details of people\u2019s lives into digital data formats (van Dijck 2014) - not only of parents themselves but also of their children. The possibilities that now exist not only for voluntary sharing of one\u2019s personal data with others, but also for data leakage and commercial exploitation of this information, are key differences between the early digital media that were available to parents and those that they currently use. \n \nIn this article, we review the literature in sociology and related social research addressing the ways in which digital media have been used for parenting-related purposes. We begin with the longer-established media of parenting websites, online discussion forums, blogs, email, mobile phones and message and video services and then move on to the newer technologies of social media and apps. This is followed by a section on data privacy and security issues. The concluding section summarises some major issues arising from the review and points to directions for further research.", "final_summary": "Digital parenting, a term that refers to the process adopted by parents to monitor and regulate their children's use of digital devices, is a topic of increasing interest in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and parenting research. \n\nCroeser (2019) introduces the concept of applying parenting theories to AI, suggesting that as AI systems become more autonomous, the principles of parenting could be used to guide their development and integration into society.

However, the abstract does not mention any specific challenges and opportunities of digital parenting.\n\nAdhe (2020) and Lupton (2016) discuss the role of digital services in parenting. Adhe (2020) presents a research on the development of a digital parenting service that integrates parenting information into society, while Lupton (2016) reviews the literature on how digital media have been used for parenting-related purposes, from websites and online forums to social media and apps.\n\nIn conclusion, the intersection of digital parenting and AI presents both challenges and opportunities. As AI systems become more autonomous, the principles of parenting could guide their development. However, the increasing surveillance of children's data raises concerns about children's digital rights and privacy. Despite these challenges, digital parenting also offers opportunities for parents to adapt their parenting styles and teach children how to use digital media and tools positively. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of this intersection for both parents and children."}, {"query": "what is the differential diagnosis for traumatic adult new midfoot collapse?", "paper_list_string": "Steiner 2018:\n\nTitle: Combined Subtalar and Naviculocuneiform Fusion for Treating Adult Acquired Flatfoot Deformity With Medial Arch Collapse at the Level of the Naviculocuneiform Joint\n\nAbstract: Background: A challenge in treating acquired flatfoot deformities is the collapse of the medial arch at the level of the naviculocuneiform (NC) joint. Triple fusions, being a treatment option, may lead to problems such as increased foot stiffness. We thus established a method that combines subtalar (ST) fusion with NC fusion while preserving the Chopart joint. We analyzed the radiographic correction, fusion rate, and patient satisfaction with this procedure. Methods: 34 feet in 31 patients (female, 23; male, 8; age 67 [45-81] years) were treated with a ST and NC joint fusion. In 15 cases, a medial sliding-osteotomy was additionally necessary to fully correct hindfoot valgus. The following radiographic parameters were measured on weightbearing radiographs preoperatively and at 2 years: talo\u2013first metatarsal angle, talocalcaneal angle, calcaneal pitch, talonavicular coverage angle and calcaneal offset. Fusion was radiologically confirmed. Results: All parameters, except the calcaneal pitch, showed a significant improvement. Fusion was observed after 1 year in all but 2 cases (94.1%). One nonunion each occurred at the ST and NC joint without needing any subsequent treatment. One patient developed avascular necrosis of the lateral talus with need for total ankle replacement after 1 year. All patients were satisfied with the obtained results. Conclusion: Our data suggest that a combined fusion of the ST and NC joint was effective and safe when treating adult acquired flatfoot with collapse of the medial arch at the level of the NC joint. Although the talonavicular joint was not fused, its subluxation was significantly reduced. Level of Evidence: Level IV, case series.\n\n==\n\nCheng 2012:\n\nTitle: A Rare Midfoot Injury Pattern: Navicular\u2014Cuneiform and Calcaneal\u2014Cuboid Fracture\u2014Dislocation\n\nAbstract: A rare midfoot injury pattern of navicular\u2014cuneiform and calcaneal\u2014cuboid fracture\u2014dislocation is presented with two typical cases and a systematic review of the literature. This injury usually occurs as a result of high-energy crushing trauma and most often causes plantarly directed dislocation of the midfoot. Initial diagnosis includes a thorough physical examination and adequate radiological imaging, comprising anteroposterior, oblique and lateral X-radiography and computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction. Care should be taken to determine any injury to adjacent midfoot joints, in particular the Lisfranc joint. Intrasurgical protection of soft tissue is essential. Open reduction using two parallel incisions with minifragment plate fixation is recommended in more comminuted injuries. The navicular\u2014cuneiform and calcaneal\u2014cuboid joints play important roles in maintaining the arch of the foot and in weight-bearing during locomotion. Without proper therapy in the immediate post-traumatic phase, the long-term results are generally unsatisfactory.\n\n==\n\nSammarco 2009:\n\nTitle: Midtarsal arthrodesis in the treatment of Charcot midfoot arthropathy.\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nFracture-dislocation of the midfoot with collapse of the longitudinal arch is common in patients with neuropathic arthropathy of the foot. In this study, we describe a technique of midfoot arthrodesis with use of intramedullary axial screw fixation and review the results and complications following use of this technique.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective study of twenty-two patients who had undergone surgical reconstruction and arthrodesis to treat Charcot midfoot deformity was performed. Bone resection and/or osteotomy were required to reduce deformity. Axially placed intramedullary screws, inserted either antegrade or retrograde across the arthrodesis sites, were used to restore the longitudinal arch. Radiographic measurements were recorded preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at the time of the last follow-up and were analyzed in order to assess the amount and maintenance of correction.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients were evaluated clinically and radiographically at an average of fifty-two months. Complete osseous union was achieved in sixteen of the twenty-two patients, at an average of 5.8 months. There were five partial unions in which a single joint did not unite in an otherwise stable foot. There was one nonunion, with recurrence of deformity. All patients returned to an independent functional ambulatory status within 9.5 months. Weight-bearing radiographs showed the talar-first metatarsal angle, the talar declination angle, and the calcaneal-fifth metatarsal angle to have improved significantly and to have been corrected to nearly normal values by the surgery. All measurements remained significantly improved, as compared with the preoperative values, at the time of final follow-up. There were no recurrent dislocations. Three patients had a recurrent plantar ulcer at the metatarsophalangeal joint that required additional surgery. There were eight cases of hardware failure.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOpen reduction and arthrodesis with use of multiple axially placed intramedullary screws for the surgical correction of neuropathic midfoot collapse provides a reliable stable construct to achieve and maintain correction of the deformity.\n\n==\n\nAkra 2010:\n\nTitle: An unusual etiology for adult-acquired flatfoot.\n\nAbstract: Rupture of the tibialis posterior tendon is widely believed to result from trauma in the presence of preexisting degenerative changes.

Conservative treatment may be very effective and includes the use of NSAIDs, custom insoles with arch support, and a rocker-bottom sole with extended steel shank with or without a SACH heel. If this treatment fails, usually a year after the injury, then arthrodesis of all the symptomatic joints with restoration of the arch and alignment of the weight-bearing surface is the recommended treatment. The long-term results of these fusions may be compromised by the subsequent development of arthritis in adjacent joints.\n\n==\n\nLi 2016:\n\nTitle: Categorization and surgical management of posttraumatic midfoot malunion\n\nAbstract: Objective To assess a classification system for midfoot injury that was based on the characteristics of the foot malunion and to evaluate the suggested treatment strategies. Methods This retrospective review of data from patients with posttraumatic midfoot malunion categorized each foot deformity into one of three types based on the foot arch and then separated these categories into one of three subtypes based on the forefoot deformity. According to the types of malunion, fascio-cutaneous flap, osteotomy, joint arthrodesis or realignment was used to correct the deformity. Patients were assessed before surgery and at 12 and 24 months postoperation. Results Of the 24 patients identified, six had Lisfranc joint injuries, nine had Lisfranc joint complex injuries combined with cuboid compression fractures and nine had Lisfranc joint complex injuries combined with navicular fractures. Overall, eight patients presented with poor soft tissue and massive scar at the dorsal foot. Visual analogue scale and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society midfoot scores significantly improved over the 24-month study period. At the end of the study, 21 of 24 patients (87.5%) rated their functional outcome as excellent or good.

The research was conducted with nursing students in health care settings through the application of teaching and learning strategies with the Self-Regulated Learning Model (SRL) and the Outcome-Present-State-Test (OPT) Model of Reflective Clinical Reasoning. Standardized nursing languages provided the content and clinical vocabulary for the clinical reasoning task. Materials and Methods: This descriptive study described the application of the OPT model of clinical reasoning, use of nursing language content, and reflective journals based on the SRL model with 66 undergraduate nursing students over an 8 month period of time. The study tested the idea that self-regulation of clinical reasoning skills can be developed using self-regulation theory and the OPT model. Results: This research supports a framework for effective teaching and learning methods to promote and document learner progress in mastering clinical reasoning skills. Self-regulated Learning strategies coupled with the OPT model suggest benefits of self-observation and self-monitoring during clinical reasoning activities, and pinpoints where guidance is needed for the development of cognitive and metacognitive awareness.

Both nutritional requirements and process parameters for submerged cultivation of the organism in bioreactor have been standardized. From the shake flask studies, glucose and ammonium citrate as carbon and nitrogen source produced maximum PHA at a ratio 20 with 3.52\u00a0g/L of dry cell weight and 70.56% of PHA content. However, ammonium sulfate as the nitrogen source was found to be more suitable for fed-batch cultivation. Several feeding strategies including pH-based fed-batch and variants of pulse feeding were studied to improve the PHA levels. pH-based feeding, although improved PHA level to 26\u00a0g/L, most of the carbon flux was diverted towards biomass formation; hence, the percent PHA was only 39.15% of the dry cell weight. Maximum PHA of 33.4\u00a0g/L, which corresponded to 88.12% of the dry cell, was obtained from high concentration single pulse method. There was a net 8.65-fold increase in PHA using this feeding strategy when compared to batch studies.

Complex interactions among concentrations of sucrose (5\u201355\u00a0g/l), urea (0.05\u20130.65\u00a0g/l) inoculum (10\u2013250\u00a0ml/l) and K2HPO4 (0.5\u20132\u00a0g/l), were studied using central composite rotatable design (CCRD) experiments. Phosphate-limiting medium (0.33\u00a0g K2HPO4/l) in the presence of excess carbon (sucrose 42.5\u00a0g/l) results in more production of PHA (2.2\u00a0g/l) in the parent strain. In comparison, the mutant strain required moderate levels of sucrose (30\u00a0g/l), along with excess of phosphate (1\u00a0g/l) for high PHA content of cell biomass (80%) and PHA yield (3.3\u00a0g/l). Optimised PHA production (biomass 4.8\u00a0g/l and PHA 3.09\u00a0g/l) by the parent strain occurred at: sucrose 51.58\u00a0g/l, urea 0.65\u00a0g/l, K2HPO4 0.48\u00a0g/l and inoculum 10\u00a0ml/l.

Biotechnological polymer production occurs in aerobic processes; therefore, only about 50% of the main carbon sources and even a lower percentage of the precursors used for production of co-polyesters end up in the products wanted. A second cost factor in normally phosphate-limited production processes for PHAs is the costs for complex nitrogen sources. Both cheap carbon sources and cheap nitrogen sources are available from agricultural waste and surplus materials and make a substantial contribution for minimizing PHA production costs. In this study, fermentations for PHA production were carried out in laboratory-scale bioreactors on hydrolyzed whey permeate and glycerol liquid phase from the biodiesel production using a highly osmophilic organism. Without any precursor, the organism produced a poly[3(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate)] copolyester on both carbon sources. During the accumulation phases, a constant 3-hydroxyvalerate content of 8-10% was obtained at a total PHA concentration of 5.5 g/L (on hydrolyzed whey permeate) and 16.2 g/L (glycerol liquid phase). In an additional fermentation, an expensive nitrogen source was substituted by meat and bone meal beside the glycerol liquid phase as a carbon source, resulting in a final PHA concentration of 5.9 g/L.\n\n==\n\nRay 2016:\n\nTitle: Optimization and characterization of PHA from isolate Pannonibacter phragmitetus ERC8 using glycerol waste.\n\nAbstract: Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have been considered as a good alternative for petrochemical based polymers due to its biodegradability. However, a high production cost limits their acceptance in industries. In present work, efforts have been made to optimize the production of PHA by Pannonibacter phragmitetus ERC8 using glycerol waste as a sole carbon source, with enhanced polymer production in a cost effective way. To check the possibility of growth and polymer accumulation potential of P. phragmitetus ERC8, various low cost substrates such as food waste, mutton tallow, whey, sugarcane bagasse, corn steep liquor and glycerol waste were used. Optimum concentration of selected factors obtained as response of statistical experimental design were 0.8% (v/v) glycerol waste, 0.26% (w/v) BHM and 1.25%OD as an inoculum for the maximum PHA production. The suggested model was validated and maximum 1.36 g/L of PHA production was obtained after 96 h. PHA production of 1.87 g/L was achieved in 5L (working volume 3 L) lab scale bioreactor with the suggested media components by RSM (Response Surface Methodology). Characterization of the PHA by NMR spectroscopy revealed that the polymer was a hetromonomer of (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate and medium chain length 3HA[(R)-3-hydroxyalkanoate] monomers.\n\n==\n\nWen 2010:\n\nTitle: Effects of phosphorus and nitrogen limitation on PHA production in activated sludge.\n\nAbstract: The effects of phosphorus and nitrogen limitation on polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production and accumulation by activated sludge biomass with acetate as a carbon source were investigated. Pre-selected influent carbon-phosphorus (C:P, W/W) of 100, 160, 250, 500 and 750, and carbon-nitrogen (C:N, W/W) of 20, 60, 100, 125 and 180 were applied in the phosphorus limitation experiments and the nitrogen limitation experiments, respectively. The maximum PHA accumulation up to 59% of the cell dry weight with a PHA productivity of 1.61 mg PHA/mg COD consumed was observed at the C:N 125 in the nitrogen limitation experiment. This value was much higher than that obtained in previous studies with a normal substrate feeding. The study showed that activated sludge biomass would produce more polyhydroxybutyrate than polyhydroxyvalerate under the stress of nutrient limitation, especially under phosphorus limitation conditions. The experimental result also indicated that both phosphorus and nitrogen limitation may cause sludge bulking.\n\n==\n\nGowda 2014:\n\nTitle: Agrowaste-based Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production using hydrolytic potential of Bacillus thuringiensis IAM 12077\n\nAbstract: The study identified the innate enzymatic potential (amylase) of the PHB producing strain B.thuringiensis IAM 12077 and explored the same for cost-effective production of PHB using agrowastes, eliminating the need for pretreatment (acid hydrolysis and/or commercial enzyme). Comparative polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production by B. thuringiensis IAM 12077 in biphasic growth conditions using glucose and starch showed\u00a0 appreciable levels of growth (5.7 and 6.8 g/L) and PHA production (58.5 and 41.5%) with a PHA yield of 3.3 and 2.8 g/L, respectively. Nitrogen deficiency supported maximum PHA yield (2.46 g/L) and accumulation (53.3%). Maximum growth (3.6 g/L), PHB yield (2.6 g/L) and PHA accumulation (72.8%) was obtained with C:N ratio of 8:1 using starch as the carbon source (10 g/L). Nine substrates (agro and food wastes) viz. rice husk, wheat bran, ragi husk, jowar husk, jackfruit seed powder, mango peel, potato peel, bagasse and straw were subjected to two treatments- acid hydrolysis and hydrolysis by innate enzymes, and\u00a0 the reducing sugars released thereby were utilized for polymer production. All the substrates tested supported comparable PHB production with acid hydrolysis (0.96 g/L-8.03 g/L) and enzyme hydrolysis (0.96 g/L -5.16 g/L). Mango peel yielded the highest PHB (4.03 g/L; 51.3%), followed by\u00a0 jackfruit seed powder (3.93 g/L; 29.32%). Varied levels of amylase activity (0.25U-10U) in all the substrates suggested the enzymatic hydrolysis of\u00a0 agrowastes.\n\n==\n\nZhang 2018:\n\nTitle: Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) production from phenol in an acclimated consortium: Batch study and impacts of operational conditions.\n\nAbstract: Microbial intracellular biopolymer PHA was synthesized from toxic pollutant phenol by an acclimated consortium. Various operational conditions were experimented for their effects on biomass growth and PHA accumulation. Carbon to nitrogen ratios from 5 to 40 (w/w) showed little impact, as did the levels of Fe, Ca and Mg in a short term. Acidic pH inhibited both growth and PHA synthesis, and an optimal dissolved oxygen level of 1-4\u202fmg\u202fL-1 was identified. Low temperature (7\u202f\u00b0C) significantly slowed but did not totally repress microbial activities. A 2% NaCl shock retarded reactions and 4% NaCl caused irreversible damage. Various initial phenol (S0) and biomass concentrations (X0) were combined to study the effect of food to microbe (F/M) ratio. High S0 and F/M exerted toxicity, reducing reaction rates but generating higher ultimate PHA wt% in biomass. Increasing X0 alleviated phenol inhibition and improved productivity and carbon conversion from phenol. A pseudo-optimized F/M ratio of 0.2-0.4 and a maximum PHA% rate of 1.15%\u202fmin-1 were identified under medium S0/high X0.

In constructing the GDS a 100-item questionnaire was administered to normal and severely depressed subjects. The 30 questions most highly correlated with the total scores were then selected and readministered to new groups of elderly subjects. These subjects were classified as normal, mildly depressed or severely depressed on the basis of Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for depression. The GDS, HRS-D and SDS were all found to be internally consistent measures, and each of the scales was correlated with the subject's number of RDC symptoms.

Homodimerization of this receptor has been suggested, but tools that allow direct assessment of the relevance of the 5-HT2AR:5-HT2AR homodimer in these disorders are necessary. We chemically modified the selective 5-HT2AR antagonist M100907 to synthesize a series of homobivalent ligands connected by ethylene glycol linkers of varying lengths that may be useful tools for probing 5-HT2AR:5-HT2AR homodimer function. We tested these molecules for 5-HT2AR antagonist activity in a cell line stably expressing the functional 5-HT2AR and quantified a downstream signaling target, activation (phosphorylation) of extracellular regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), in comparison to in vivo efficacy of altering spontaneous or cocaine-evoked locomotor activity in rats. All of the synthetic compounds inhibited 5-HT-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the cellular signaling assay; the potency of the bivalent ligands varied as a function of linker length, with the intermediate linker lengths being the most potent. The Ki values for the binding of bivalent ligands to 5-HT2AR were only slightly lower than the values for the parent (+)-M100907 compound, but significant selectivity for 5-HT2AR over 5-HT2BR or 5-HT2CR binding was retained. In addition, the 11-atom-linked bivalent 5-HT2AR antagonist (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) demonstrated efficacy on par with that of (+)-M100907 in inhibiting cocaine-evoked hyperactivity. As we develop further strategies for ligand-evoked receptor assembly and analyses of diverse signaling and functional roles, these novel homobivalent 5-HT2AR antagonist ligands will serve as useful in vitro and in vivo probes of 5-HT2AR structure and function.\n\n==\n\nWillmann 2021:\n\nTitle: Radiosynthesis and Biological Evaluation of [18F]R91150, a Selective 5-HT2A Receptor Antagonist for PET-Imaging.\n\nAbstract: Serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors in cortical and forebrain regions are an important substrate for the neuromodulatory actions of serotonin in the brain. They have been implicated in the etiology of many neuropsychiatric disorders and serve as a target for antipsychotic, antidepressant, and anxiolytic drugs. Positron emission tomography imaging using suitable radioligands can be applied for in vivo quantification of receptor densities and receptor occupancy for therapy evaluation. Recently, the radiosynthesis of the selective 5-HT2AR antagonist [18F]R91150 was reported. However, the six-step radiosynthesis is cumbersome and time-consuming with low radiochemical yields (RCYs) of <5%. In this work, [18F]R91150 was prepared using late-stage Cu-mediated radiofluorination to simplify its synthesis. The detailed protocol enabled us to obtain RCYs of 14 \u00b1 1%, and the total synthesis time was reduced to 60 min. In addition, autoradiographic studies with [18F]R91150 in rat brain slices revealed the typical uptake pattern of 5-HT2A receptor ligands.\n\n==\n\nSchmidt 1992:\n\nTitle: The 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, MDL 28,133A, disrupts the serotonergic-dopaminergic interaction mediating the neurochemical effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine.\n\nAbstract: The selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist MDL 28,133A dose dependently-blocked the long-term deficits in rat brain 5-HT concentrations produced by the substituted amphetamine analogue 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). This protective effect of MDL 28,133A could be abolished by coadministration of the dopamine precursor, L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). Electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that the ability of MDL 28,133A to block the MDMA-induced slowing of A9 dopaminergic neurons was also sensitive to L-DOPA administration. Both sets of experiments suggest an interaction of MDL 28,133A at the level of dopamine synthesis. Consistent with this explanation, MDL 28,133A antagonized the MDMA-induced stimulation of dopamine synthesis in vivo. MDMA-induced 5-HT release did not reduce the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons as assessed by dopamine depletion following synthesis inhibition with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT). This indicates that the effect of 5-HT2 receptor antagonists on MDMA-induced dopamine synthesis is not due simply to the removal of an inhibitory serotonergic input followed by an increase in dopamine cell firing and autoreceptor activation. MDL 28,133A was also shown to be without effect on the sensitivity of terminal dopamine autoreceptors. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that 5-HT2 receptors are permissive for the stimulation of dopamine synthesis necessary to support MDMA-induced transmitter efflux.\n\n==\n\nBartoszyk 2003:\n\nTitle: EMD 281014, a new selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist.\n\nAbstract: The 5-HT2A receptor ligand 7-[4-[2-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-ethyl]-piperazine-1-carbonyl]-1H-indole-3-carbonitrile HCl (EMD 281014) selectively binds to human (h) and rat 5-HT2A receptors (IC50 values 0.35 and 1 nM, respectively; vs. 1334 nM for h5-HT2C) and inhibited 5-HT-stimulated [35S]guanosine 5'-O-3-thiotriphosphate (GTPgammaS)-accumulation in h5-HT2A transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (IC50 9.3 nM). EMD 28014 counteracted the N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ)-induced decrease of [3H]ketanserin binding in rat frontal cortex (ID50 0.4 mg/kg p.o.) and R-(-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-aminopropane (DOI)-induced head-twitch behaviour in mice (ID50 0.01 mg/kg s.c., 0.06 mg/kg p.o.), demonstrating unique selectivity and efficacy.\n\n==\n\nBONHAUS 1997:\n\nTitle: RS-102221: A Novel High Affinity and Selective, 5-HT2C Receptor Antagonist\n\nAbstract: The 5-HT2C receptor is one of three closely related receptor subtypes in the 5-HT2 receptor family. 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B selective antagonists have been described. However, no 5-HT2C selective antagonists have yet been disclosed. As part of an effort to further explore the function of 5-HT2C receptors, we have developed a selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, RS-102221 (a benzenesulfonamide of 8-[5-(5-amino-2,4-dimethoxyphenyl) 5-oxopentyl]-1,3,8-triazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione). This compound exhibited nanomolar affinity for human (pKi = 8.4) and rat (pKi = 8.5) 5-HT2C receptors. The compound also demonstrated nearly 100-fold selectivity for the 5-HT2C receptor as compared to the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors. RS-102221 acted as an antagonist in a cell-based microphysiometry functional assay (pA2 = 8.1) and had no detectable intrinsic efficacy. Consistent with its action as a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, daily dosing with RS-102221 (2 mg/kg intraperitoneal) increased food-intake and weight-gain in rats. Surprisingly, RS-102221 failed to reverse the hypolocomotion induced by the 5-HT2 receptor agonist 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (m-CPP). It is concluded that RS-102221 is the first selective, high affinity 5-HT2C receptor antagonist to be described.\n\n==\n\nBryant 1996:\n\nTitle: A novel class of 5-HT2A receptor antagonists: aryl aminoguanidines.\n\nAbstract: Local delivery of serotonin (5-HT) produces a rapid edematous response in soft tissues via increased fluid extravasation which is prevented by 5-HT2 antagonists such as ketanserin or mianserin. Here we report the effects of a new class of aminoguanidine 5-HT2 antagonists, with relative selectivity for 5-HT2A receptors which are potent inhibitors of 5-HT-induced paw edema in the rat. Radioligand binding studies with 125I DOI on human 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and with 3H-5-HT on human 5-HT2B receptors demonstrated that, LY314228, and LY320954 displayed some selectivity for the 5-HT2A receptor. When compared to binding at other 5-HT2 receptor subtypes, LY314228 had an 18.6-fold greater affinity for the 5-HT2A site over the 5-HT2B site, and 2.6 fold greater at the 5-HT2C site. LY320954 displayed similar preference for 5-HT2A sites. Both compounds also inhibited 5-HT-induced paw swelling in rats, with ED50's of 6.4 and 4.8 mg/kg (for LY314228 and LY320954, respectively). These studies offer evidence for a novel class of pharmacophores for the 5-HT2 receptor family which show greater relative affinities for the 5-HT2A receptor subclass.\n\n==\n\nStevenson 2000:\n\nTitle: 2-Aryl tryptamines: selective high-affinity antagonists for the h5-HT2A receptor.\n\nAbstract: A series of 2-aryl tryptamines have been identified as high-affinity h5-HT2A antagonists.

All vehicles are supposed to be fully autonomous and can communicate with the intersection management unit to check the traffic situation. Priority of passing the intersection is decided by a static conflict matrix which represents the potential conflict between lanes of different directions and a dynamic information list which could capture the real-time occupation of each lane in the intersection. Compared with the existing approaches in the literature, the intersection management unit in our strategy is more like a database rather than a computational center, and therefore, requires less computational resource and more likely satisfies the real-time requirement in heavy traffic situations. Simulations are conducted using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility), in which the proposed strategy is compared with both fixed and adaptive traffic light methods. The results indicate that the proposed strategy could significantly reduce the average time delay caused by the intersection and the corresponding variance, which shows the efficiency and fairness of the proposed strategy in intersection management.\n\n==\n\nWuthishuwong 2015:\n\nTitle: Safe trajectory planning for autonomous intersection management by using vehicle to infrastructure communication\n\nAbstract: The development of autonomous vehicle or self-driving car integrates with the wireless communication technology which would be a forward step for road transportation in the near future. The autonomous crossing of an intersection with an autonomous vehicle will play a crucial role in the future of intelligent transportation system (ITS). The fundamental objectives of this work are to manage autonomous vehicles crossing an intersection with no collisions, maintaining that a vehicle drives continuously, and to decrease the waiting time at an intersection. In this paper, a discrete model of the one-way single intersection is designed. The vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication is implemented to exchange information between a vehicle and an intersection manager which is the roadside infrastructure. The safe trajectory of autonomous vehicles for the autonomous intersection management is determined and presented by using discrete mathematics.\n\n==\n\nHausknecht 2011:\n\nTitle: Autonomous Intersection Management: Multi-intersection optimization\n\nAbstract: Advances in autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems indicate a rapidly approaching future in which intelligent vehicles will automatically handle the process of driving. However, increasing the efficiency of today's transportation infrastructure will require intelligent traffic control mechanisms that work hand in hand with intelligent vehicles. To this end, Dresner and Stone proposed a new intersection control mechanism called Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) and showed in simulation that by studying the problem from a multiagent perspective, intersection control can be made more efficient than existing control mechanisms such as traffic signals and stop signs. We extend their study beyond the case of an individual intersection and examine the unique implications and abilities afforded by using AIM-based agents to control a network of interconnected intersections. We examine different navigation policies by which autonomous vehicles can dynamically alter their planned paths, observe an instance of Braess' paradox, and explore the new possibility of dynamically reversing the flow of traffic along lanes in response to minute-by-minute traffic conditions. Studying this multiagent system in simulation, we quantify the substantial improvements in efficiency imparted by these agent-based traffic control methods.\n\n==\n\nWuthishuwong 2017:\n\nTitle: Consensus-based local information coordination for the networked control of the autonomous intersection management\n\nAbstract: Autonomous intersection management (AIM) will be a future method for improving traffic efficiency in the urban area. Instead of using the traffic signal control like nowadays, it uses wireless communication with autonomous vehicles to support the management of road traffic more safely and efficiently. A single AIM shows an exceptional performance in managing traffics at an intersection. However, it could not be represented a traffic in the real world, which is composed of multiple intersections. We show that coordination of traffic information among vehicles and infrastructures is an essential part of macroscopic traffic management. Coordination of traffic information among the network of AIMs is the key to improve the overall traffic flow throughout the network not only has an optimal flow in some intersections and very heavy traffic in others. In this paper, we introduce the distributed control to a graph-based intersection network to control traffic in a macroscopic level. Vehicle to infrastructure and infrastructure to infrastructure communication are used to exchange the traffic information between a single autonomous vehicle to the network of autonomous intersections. We implement a discrete time consensus algorithm to coordinate the traffic density of an intersection with its neighborhoods and determine the control policy to maximize a traffic throughput of each intersection as well as stabilizing the overall traffic in the network. We use the Greenshields traffic model to define the boundary condition of various traffic flows to the corresponded traffic density and velocity. Our proposed method represents the ability to maintain traffic flow rate of each intersection without having a back up traffic. As well, every intersection operates under the uncongested flow condition. The simulation results of the graph-based networked control of a multiple autonomous intersection showed that the overall traffic flow in the network achieves up to $$20\\%$$20% higher than using traffic signal system.\n\n==\n\nAzimi 2014:\n\nTitle: STIP: Spatio-temporal intersection protocols for autonomous vehicles\n\nAbstract: Autonomous driving is likely to be the heart of urban transportation in the future. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to increase the safety of passengers and also to make road trips shorter and more enjoyable. As the first steps toward these goals, many car manufacturers are investing in designing and equipping their vehicles with advanced driver-assist systems. Road intersections are considered to be serious bottlenecks of urban transportation, as more than 44% of all reported crashes in U.S. occur within intersection areas which in turn lead to 8,500 fatalities and approximately 1 million injuries every year. Furthermore, the impact of road intersections on traffic delays leads to enormous waste of human and natural resources. In this paper, we therefore focus on intersection management in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) research. In the future, when dealing with autonomous vehicles, it is critical to address safety and throughput concerns that arise from autonomous driving through intersections and roundabouts. Our goal is to provide vehicles with a safe and efficient passage method through intersections and roundabouts. We have been investigating vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications as a part of co-operative driving in the context of autonomous driving. We have designed and developed efficient and reliable intersection protocols to avoid vehicle collisions at intersections and increase traffic throughput. In this paper, we introduce new V2V intersection protocols to achieve the above goals. We show that, in addition to intersections, these protocols are also applicable to vehicle crossings at roundabouts. Additionally, we study the effects of position inaccuracy of commonly-used GPS devices on some of our V2V intersection protocols and suggest required modifications to guarantee their safety and efficiency despite these impairments. Our simulation results show that we are able to avoid collisions and also increase the throughput of the intersections up to 87.82% compared to common traffic-light signalized intersections.\n\n==\n\nDai 2016:\n\nTitle: Quality-of-Experience-Oriented Autonomous Intersection Control in Vehicular Networks\n\nAbstract: Recent advances in autonomous vehicles and vehicular communications are envisioned to enable novel approaches to managing and controlling traffic intersections. In particular, with intersection controller units (ICUs), passing vehicles can be instructed to cross the intersection safely without traffic signals. Previous efforts on autonomous intersection control mainly focused on guaranteeing the safe passage of vehicles and improving intersection throughput, without considering the quality of the travel experience from the passengers' perspective. In this paper, we aim to design an enhanced autonomous intersection control mechanism, which not only ensures vehicle safety and enhances traffic efficiency but also cares about the travel experience of passengers. In particular, we design the metric of smoothness to quantitatively capture the quality of experience. In addition, we consider the travel time of individual vehicles when passing the intersection in scheduling to avoid a long delay of some vehicles, which not only helps with improving intersection throughput but also enhances the system's fairness. With the above considerations, we formulate the intersection control model and transform it into a convex optimization problem. On this basis, we propose a new algorithm to achieve an optimal solution with low overhead. Finally, we build the simulation model and implement the algorithm for performance evaluation. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.\n\n==\n\nWuthishuwong 2013:\n\nTitle: Coordination of multiple autonomous intersections by using local neighborhood information\n\nAbstract: Traffic congestion is considered one of the most important problems of road transportation. The concept of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has been introduced to improve the efficiency of the traffic flow. The autonomous vehicle technology is slowly becoming a reality, alongside wireless communication technology, which is becoming a major role in vehicle communication. Wireless communication devices will be generally used in vehicles for the future road transportation. The purpose of this research work is to use the local traffic information to reduce delay time of a vehicle at an intersection. In this paper, the fully autonomous intersection system is represented as a single intersection model. In addition, the multiple intersections are created based on the connection of a single autonomous intersection agent. The communication topology of the intersection network is modeled by using the undirected graph. The traffic information in the network is able to be exchanged by Infrastructure-to-Infrastructure (I2I) communication. This discrete consensus algorithm is implemented for coordinating the local traffic information and the neighborhood intersection. The proposed method works, based on the concept Green Wave, which maximizes the throughput, as well as minimizing the delay time. It maintains the traffic density of every intersection in the network to manage every vehicle for a continuous drive with a minimal delay time. The simulation of variable traffic flow rate of multiple autonomous intersections is implemented based on the proposed method.\n\n==\n\nGregoire 2016:\n\nTitle: Hybrid centralized/distributed autonomous intersection control: Using a job scheduler as a planner and inheriting its efficiency guarantees\n\nAbstract: We propose a hybrid centralized/distributed architecture to coordinate autonomous vehicles at intersections.

Efficiency bounds for the coordination system are inherited from efficiency guarantees of the job scheduling policy.

The clinical characteristics and the long-term outcome of these silent adenomas, which show no signs of endocrine hyperfunction, differ from those of other types of pituitary adenomas. However, to date, no study has focused specifically on gonadotropic adenomas.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTo identify prognostic factors of R/P of remnants, we studied the postoperative outcome of 32 gonadotropic pituitary adenomas, defined on immunohistochemical staining, according to their clinical and radiological characteristics as well as the Ki-67 labeling index (LI).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe Ki-67 LI failed to provide independent information for the identification of patients at risk of progression of remnants or recurrence. Multivariate survival analysis (Cox regression) showed that neither invasiveness nor remnant tumors nor hyposomatotropism influenced tumor recurrence. The strongest predicting factors of R/P were the antero-posterior (AP) diameter in the sagittal plane (P = 0.014), and the age of the patient at surgery (P = 0.047), with younger patients being at greater risk.

Increased serum gonadotropin concentrations were shown in 3 patients. Reduced levels of testosterone were present in 9 patients, and normal in the remainder. At diagnosis all patients had pituitary macroadenomas, with wide extrasellar extension in 12. All patients underwent trans-sphenoidal surgery and immunohistochemical staining of surgically excised specimens showed the presence of gonadotroph and alpha-subunit cells in all pituitary adenomas. After surgery 3 patients had clear radiological evidence of normal pituitary; in the others a doubtful MRI picture or a residual adenomatous tissue were present. In the patients who did not undergo radiotherapy immediately after surgery, a regrowth of tumoral tissue was shown in 1-10 yrs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe stress the importance of a close follow-up of patients with gonadotroph adenomas after surgery, and we raise the question of whether radiotherapy may be useful for avoiding any further adenomatous regrowth.\n\n==\n\nSalmi 1982:\n\nTitle: Recurrence of chromophobe pituitary adenomas after operation and postoperative radiotherapy\n\nAbstract: The rate of recurrence is reported in a prospective study of 56 patients (28 men, 28 women) with large chromophobe pituitary adenoma (with or without hyperprolactinemia). The surgical approach was transfrontal in 44 and transseptosphenoidal in 12 patients. Cryoapplication was combined with the transsphenoidal operation. All but one patient received post\u2010operative pituitary irradiation. Altogether, 11 (20 %) clinical relapses (10 men) occurred between 0.5 and 6 years after the transfrontal operation. Patients that relapsed had had larger tumors than those remaining in remission. Occurrence of the tumors appeared with a deterioration of the visual field defect in 9 patients. There were no differences in the degrees of hypopituitarism in patients who relapsed as compared to patients remaining in remission.\n\n==\n\nLosa 2004:\n\nTitle: Endocrine inactive and gonadotroph adenomas: diagnosis and management\n\nAbstract: Endocrine inactive pituitary adenomas represent about one quarter of all pituitary tumors. By immunocytochemistry, most of these tumors are positive for intact gonadotropins and/or their subunits. Clinical presentation is usually secondary to mass effect symptoms, such as visual disturbances, headache, and hypopituitarism. Differential diagnosis is usually accomplished by neuroradiologic studies, even though in selected cases positron emission tomography and/or single photon emission tomography may aid to distinguish pituitary adenomas from other endocrine inactive lesions, such as meningiomas and craniopharyngiomas. Surgical management is usually considered the first choice treatment for patients with endocrine inactive pituitary adenomas because it is very effective in ameliorating symptoms of chiasmal compression and headache. Radical removal of the tumor, however, is difficult to obtain because of the frequent invasiveness into the cavernous sinus. Radiation therapy diminishes the likelihood of tumor recurrence, especially in patients with demonstrable tumor remnants after surgery. Medical therapy with dopaminergic drugs, somatostatin analogs, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists causes mild reduction of tumor size in few patients and, therefore, seems to be of limited value in the therapeutic management of patients with endocrine inactive pituitary adenomas.\n\n==\n\nSnyder 1987:\n\nTitle: Gonadotroph cell pituitary adenomas.\n\nAbstract: The frequency of gonadotroph cell adenomas among all unselected pituitary adenomas is likely much higher than previously suspected. The prevalence in one series of 139 men with pituitary macroadenomas was 17 per cent (24 per cent if adenomas secreting only alpha subunit are included). The clinical characteristics of patients with gonadotroph cell adenomas are similar. Most are middle-aged men who have a history of normal pubertal development and a normal fertility history and by examination are normally virilized and have testes of normal size. They are brought to medical attention because of visual impairment, which is the result of the enormous size of the adenoma. The most common hormonal characteristics of gonadotroph cell adenomas in vivo is hypersecretion of FSH, which is often accompanied by hypersecretion of FSH-beta and alpha subunits and less often by hypersecretion of LH-beta or intact LH. Another common characteristic is secretion of FSH and/or LH-beta in response to TRH. A few patients with gonadotroph cell adenomas hypersecrete intact LH and therefore have supranormal serum testosterone concentrations. A larger number have secondary hypogonadism, because the adenomas are not secreting intact LH but are compressing the normal gonadotroph cells and impairing LH secretion. These patients have concentrations of intact LH that are not elevated, despite subnormal testosterone concentrations. The testosterone increases markedly in response to human chorionic gonadotropin. Both the clinical and hormonal characteristics of gonadotroph cell adenomas usually make them readily distinguishable from pituitary enlargement due to long-standing primary hypogonadism. Most gonadotroph cell adenomas are now managed first by transsphenoidal surgery to attempt to restore vision as quickly as possible, and then by supervoltage radiation to prevent regrowth of the remaining adenomatous tissue. Surgery usually does improve vision, as well as the pretreatment hormonal abnormalities, and radiation reduces FSH hypersecretion further. Dopamine agonist therapy is experimental but warrants further trial. The hormonal abnormalities detected prior to treatment, such as supranormal basal concentrations of FSH, alpha, and FSH-beta and the FSH and LH-beta responses to TRH, can be used to monitor the response to therapy.\n\n==\n\nMor 2005:\n\nTitle: Diagnosis of pituitary gonadotroph adenomas in reproductive-aged women.\n\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nTo describe the clinical symptoms associated with the diagnosis of pituitary gonadotroph adenoma in premenopausal women.\n\n\nDESIGN\nReport of three separate cases.\n\n\nSETTING\nUniversity medical center.\n\n\nPATIENT(S)\nThree patients: a 31-year-old woman with primary infertility, recurrent adnexal masses, and highly elevated estradiol level; a 30-year-old woman with recurrent multicystic ovaries following multiple cystectomies and transvaginal cyst aspirations, and elevated estradiol level; a 43-year-old woman with bilateral complex cystic adnexal masses and an elevated estradiol level, who underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for a suspected granulosa cell tumor.\n\n\nINTERVENTION(S)\nTranssphenoidal resection of a pituitary mass.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)\nSerum estradiol, FSH, and LH levels; transvaginal ultrasonography of the ovaries; histologic examination of pituitary tumors.\n\n\nRESULT(S)\nTranssphenoidal resection of pituitary adenomas resulted in normalization of serum estradiol and FSH levels and resolution of adnexal masses in two of the women.\n\n\nCONCLUSION(S)\nPituitary gonadotroph adenoma must be considered in the differential diagnosis in reproductive-aged women presenting with the clinical symptom triad of new onset oligomenorrhea, bilateral cystic adnexal masses, and elevated estradiol and FSH levels with suppressed levels of LH; timely diagnosis may prevent unnecessary and potentially damaging surgical procedures.\n\n==\n\nLanglois 2017:\n\nTitle: Clinical profile of silent growth hormone pituitary adenomas; higher recurrence rate compared to silent gonadotroph pituitary tumors, a large single center experience\n\nAbstract: PurposeStudy and comparison of characteristics of silent growth hormone adenomas (SGHA), silent corticotroph adenomas (SCA), and silent gonadotroph adenomas (SGA) in a single institution cohort of surgically treated pituitary adenomas.MethodsRetrospective analysis of SGHA surgically resected over 10 years: SGHA was defined as no clinical or biochemical evidence of acromegaly and positive GH immunostaining.ResultsOf 814 pituitary surgeries; 2.1% (n\u2009=\u200917) were SGHA, 4.5% (n\u2009=\u200937) SCA, and 18.9% (n\u2009=\u200970/371; 2011\u20132016) SGA. Mean age at SGHA diagnosis was 43 years, with a large female predominance (82%). Mean tumor size and cavernous/sphenoid sinus invasiveness for SGHA, SCA, and SGA were 1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0\u2009cm and 25%, 2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u2009cm and 43%, 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u2009cm and 41%, respectively (tumor size p\u2009=\u20090.009, SGHA vs. SGA, and invasion p; not-significant). During mean follow-up of 3.9 years, two patients (11%) developed elevated insulin-like growth factor-1 and five patients (29%) required a second surgery for tumor recurrence. Rate of surgical reintervention was similar to SCA (31%), but higher than SGA (10%) (p\u2009=\u20090.035, SGHA vs. SGA), and 18% underwent radiation therapy, similar to SCA (19%, p; not-significant) but higher than SGA (2.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.018).ConclusionThis is the largest single center study characterizing SGHA behavior with SGA and SCA control groups in a cohort of surgically resected pituitary adenomas. SGHA present mostly in young females, and should be closely followed due to their higher likelihood of recurrence and potential of progression to clinical acromegaly. We propose that a complete hormonal staining panel be routinely performed for all pituitary adenomas.\n\n==\n\nYoung 1996:\n\nTitle: Gonadotroph adenoma of the pituitary gland: a clinicopathologic analysis of 100 cases.\n\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the clinical and pathologic features in a large cohort of randomly selected patients with gonadotroph pituitary adenomas.\n\n\nDESIGN\nWe retrospectively reviewed clinical, surgical, and pathologic findings in 100 patients (79 men and 21 women, 30 to 82 years old) with this tumor.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDiagnosis of a pituitary tumor was prompted by visual loss (43%), symptoms of hypopituitarism (22%), headache (8%), or a combination of these findings (10%); 17% of the patients were asymptomatic. Visual field defects were present in 68% of the study group, and complete or partial anterior pituitary failure was present in 77%. Serum prolactin concentrations were increased (maximum, 110 ng/mL) in 33% of patients. Hypersecretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) was documented in 11 and 5 patients, respectively. The serum level of alpha-subunit was increased in 1 of 29 patients in whom it was measured. All patients had pituitary macroadenomas, only 21% of which were grossly invasive. The surgical approach was transsphenoidal in all but two patients, who underwent transfrontal craniotomy; gross total tumor resection was achieved in 90%. By definition, all tumors had at least 10% immunoreactivity for LH, FSH, or both. All tumors were chromophobic. Ultrastructurally, the tumors were characterized as gonadotroph adenomas of \"male\" (45%) or \"female\" (9%) type as well as null-cell adenomas of the oncocytic (35%) or nononcocytic (11%) type. After a median follow-up of 4.3 years, 69% of the patients who had had visual field defects noted normalization or improvement. Persistent or clinically recurrent pituitary tumor tissue was present in 42%. A second pituitary surgical procedure was required in eight patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMost patients with clinically evident gonadotroph pituitary tumors have loss of vision and hypopituitarism. Hypersecretion of FSH or LH is unusual, and no distinct hormone-dependent clinical phenotype is present. Transsphenoidal surgical treatment generally yields normalization or improvement of visual field defects.", "final_summary": "Gonadotroph pituitary adenomas, a type of pituitary tumor, have been the subject of numerous studies due to their high recurrence rate after primary surgery. \n\nDubois (2007) found that the age of the patient at surgery and the antero-posterior diameter of the tumor were the strongest predictors of recurrence or progression. Younger patients and those with larger tumors were at a higher risk. Manieri (2000) emphasized the importance of close follow-up after surgery, suggesting that radiotherapy might be beneficial in preventing further adenomatous regrowth. \n\nSalmi (1982) reported a 20% clinical relapse rate between 0.5 and 6 years after surgery, with larger tumors being more likely to recur. Losa (2004) noted that radiation therapy reduces the likelihood of tumor recurrence, especially in patients with demonstrable tumor remnants after surgery. \n\nSnyder (1987) suggested that supervoltage radiation after surgery can prevent regrowth of the remaining adenomatous tissue. Young (1996) reported that persistent or clinically recurrent pituitary tumor tissue was present in 42% of patients, with a second pituitary surgical procedure required in eight patients. \n\nIn conclusion, the recurrence of gonadotroph pituitary adenomas after primary surgery is a significant concern. Factors such as the patient's age at surgery, tumor size, and the presence of tumor remnants after surgery can influence the likelihood of recurrence. Close follow-up and consideration of additional treatments such as radiotherapy may be beneficial in managing this condition. The findings from each paper contribute to our understanding of the recurrence of gonadotroph pituitary adenomas after primary surgery (Dubois, 2007; Manieri, 2000; Salmi, 1982; Losa, 2004; Snyder, 1987; Young, 1996)."}, {"query": "What do scenarios mean for the future of geopolitics?

They have the potential to contribute to several high-priority tasks for Arctic research, such as integration of indigenous and local knowledge in futures studies, providing a platform for activating Arctic youth in shaping their futures, identifying Arctic-relevant indicators for sustainable development, and supporting decision-making towards sustainable futures. Yet, to achieve this potential, several methodological challenges need to be addressed. These include attention to whose voices are amplified or silenced in participatory research practices, with special attention to diversification and the engagement of youth. Given the historic and potential future role of disruptive events for Arctic development trajectories, methods are needed in participatory scenario exercises to include attention to the dynamics and consequences of such events and regime shifts. Participatory scenarios can also be further improved through approaches that effectively combine qualitative and quantitative information. Finally, there is a need for systematic studies of how the results of scenario exercises influence decision-making processes. This article elaborates on ways in which attention to these aspects can help make scenarios more robust for assessing a diversity of potential Arctic futures in times of rapid environmental and social change.\n\n==\n\nErokhin 2020:\n\nTitle: Regional scenarios of the Arctic futures: A review\n\nAbstract: The future of the Arctic region is a subject of heated debates in both scientific and policy circles. The region has an enormous economic potential as a storehouse of mineral resources and as a provider of shorter and more cost-effective transportation between Europe and Asia. The Arctic is therefore an essential strategic element of the domestic and foreign policies of all Arctic states. In addition, there is an increasing economic interest in the region on the part of non-Arctic states. However, at present, the future of the Arctic region development remains highly uncertain. Scenario building is a suitable methodology to imagine alternative plausible futures of such a complex and multi-dimensional process and to elaborate successful and robust development strategies. This paper provides an overview of the scenario frameworks of Arctic futures presented in the literature and analyses key factors that determine these scenarios. Overall, we find a growing interest of the international foresight research community in the Arctic region that is evident from a number of thorough scenario-building exercises published recently. At the same time, we observe two drawbacks. First, the existing studies lack a numerical element, that is, the overwhelming majority of the scenario frameworks that can be found in the literature are fully qualitative. Quantitative estimates would strengthen the scenario narratives and enrich communication, which make them a useful addition to support a qualitative scenario framework. Second, the existing studies use a mixture of both internal and external factors to describe the underlying uncertainty. This limits the number of factors that can be taken into consideration and may be confusing for a potential user of these scenario frameworks due to the lack of a systemic view. Such a confusion can happen, for example, if some of the external factors underpinning a particular scenario suddenly develop in a direction that was not anticipated within the scenario framework. The effect of such a change on the set of scenarios and the validity of the scenarios despite this change will be of interest to the user, and a clear systems perspective would be conducive to address these questions. Separating internal and external factors in a scenario building exercise is particularly useful given that the volatility of the global geopolitical, geoeconomic and environmental dynamics is only increasing. It is our intention to address these two drawbacks in a scenario building exercise within the \u201cEmerging trade routes between Europe and Asia\u201d scenario-building project led by IIASA within the Northern Dimension Institute (NDI) Think Tank Action co-funded by the European Union and coordinated by Aalto University, Finland.\n\n==\n\nHaavisto 2016:\n\nTitle: Socio-economic scenarios for the Eurasian arctic by 2040\n\nAbstract: Improved weather and marine services (WMS) can have a role to play in the safe and secure development of the Arctic region through either a demand-pull (enhanced by growth in activity) or a supply-push (enhances growth in activity) process. To analyse the nature of the process and the future use and benefits of WMS, a better understanding of possible future developments in the Eurasian Arctic is needed. This report presents six socio-economic scenarios for the Eurasian Arctic by 2040, and a brief synopsis of the implications of each scenario for WMS. The scenarios focus on the development of shipping, resource extraction and tourism industries. The scenario futures, called Wild West, Silicon Valley, Exploited Colony, Shangri La, Conflict Zone and Antarctic, describe the scale and scope of activities in the Eurasian Arctic by 2040. The scenarios have three dimensions: open \u2013 closed, public private and dirty \u2013 clean, which describe the political, economic, social, technological and environmental aspects of different futures. The scenarios are based on a literature review, pre-survey, expert workshop and restructuring and analysis of this material. The methodology used for scenario construction is described in detail and may be used widely by other scenario developers. Our analysis shows that plenty of potential pressures for major changes in the Eurasian Arctic exist. Environmental changes, political shifts and technological development can all push forward drastic new developments in the region. Then again, it is possible that despite all the hype and interest, the Eurasian Arctic remains backwater areas in the global economy. This emphasizes the need for any decision-maker to be able to respond to very different futures. Therefore, robust decision making, a good eye for weak signals and tipping points, and the ability to prepare for risks and seize opportunities as they emerge is required in the Eurasian Arctic. The development of WMS is important in ensuring the safe and secure development of the Eurasian Arctic, unless the development follows the path of \u201cAntarctica\u201d with tourism and research as main activities in the marine regions.\n\n==\n\nKeys 2021:\n\nTitle: Visions of the Arctic Future: Blending Computational Text Analysis and Structured Futuring to Create Story\u2010Based Scenarios\n\nAbstract: The future of Arctic social systems and natural environments is highly uncertain. Climate change will lead to unprecedented phenomena in the pan\u2010Arctic region, such as regular shipping traffic through the Arctic Ocean, urban growth, military activity, expanding agricultural frontiers, and transformed Indigenous societies. While intergovernmental to local organizations have produced numerous synthesis\u2010based visions of the future, a challenge in any scenario exercise is capturing the \u201cpossibility\u201d space of change. In this work, we employ a computational text analysis to generate unique thematic input for novel, story\u2010based visions of the Arctic. Specifically, we develop a corpus of more than 2,000 articles in publicly accessible, English\u2010language Arctic newspapers that discuss the future in the Arctic. We then perform a latent Dirichlet allocation, resulting in 10 distinct topics and sets of associated keywords. From these topics and keywords, we design ten story\u2010based scenarios employing the M\u0101noa mashup, science fiction prototyping, and other methods. Our results demonstrate that computational text analysis can feed directly into a creative futuring process, whereby the output stories can be traced clearly back to the original topics and keywords. We discuss our findings in the context of the broader field of Arctic scenarios and show that the results of this computational text analysis produce complementary stories to the existing scenario literature. We conclude that story\u2010based scenarios can provide vital texture toward understanding the myriad possible Arctic futures.\n\n==\n\nZaikov 2019:\n\nTitle: Scenarios for the development of the Arctic region (2020\u20132035)\n\nAbstract: . The importance of selecting the development of the Arctic seems to be relevant since rapid and irreversible changes are taking place there. Climate change and globalization are their prominent examples. A complex of factors has both positive and negative impacts on the use of natural resources and the positioning of states located not only within the Arctic but also outside it. The questions arise: what is the significance of these changes for geography, politics, and the management system? How should the compre-hension of these processes be built? The relevance of the topic is enhanced by the fact that Russia has the most significant Arctic sector among the states with access to the Arctic Ocean. Therefore, our country has a leading role in working out strategies for the development of the Arctic. The comprehensive approach (considering the economic and political-geographical positions) is central in the article to analyze the directions of development of the Arctic territories. The method reveals the possibilities of sustainable development, which will provide Russia with strategic benefits within the Arctic and globally. The article discusses scenarios for the development of the Arctic, including the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation, in the long-term perspective (until 2035). Substantiation of the long-term prospects for the development of the Arctic, despite Russian and foreign research, seems to be unrealistic due to lack of knowledge about the nature and consequences of climatic changes currently observed in this region and affecting global environmental management. The authors concluded that the priority directions of the Arctic development should be the ones based on positive and innovative trends.\n\n==\n\nBrigham 2008:\n\nTitle: The Future of Arctic Marine Navigation in Mid-Century - Scenario Narratives\n\nAbstract: This document serves as the final Scenario Narratives Report for the Future of Arctic Marine Navigation in Mid-Century, a project of the Arctic Council\u2019s Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment (PAME) working group and Global Business Network (GBN), a member of the Monitor Group. The purpose of this project, and these scenarios, is to systematically consider the long-term social, technological, economic, environmental, and political impacts on Arctic Marine Navigation of Key Finding #6 of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) published by the Arctic Council and the International Arctic Science Committee in November 2004. These scenarios are meant to summarize and communicate a set of plausible and different stories of the future in which critical uncertainties play out in ways that challenge planning decisions being made in the present. For this scenarios project on the Future of Arctic Marine Navigation, we convened two workshops to gather the perspectives and ideas of a highly diverse group of stakeholders. The first workshop was held at the GBN office in San Francisco in April 2007, and the second at the offices of Aker Arctic Technology in Helsinki in July 2007. Because this project rests on Key Finding #6, all of the scenarios assume continued global climate change that results in significantly less Arctic ice cover, at least in the summer, throughout the 2030s and 2040s. It is our intention that these scenarios will provide material for deeper discussions about the future and earlier decisions by the countries, peoples, and industries active in the Arctic region.\n\n==\n\nWormbs 2017:\n\nTitle: Arctic Futures: Agency and Assessing Assessments\n\nAbstract: The future is a common theme in discussions of the Arctic, whether in media, policy, or scientific communications. The future is not a given, and there are several possible futures that different actors strive to enable at any given time. At present considerable attention is given to monolithic \u201cdrivers\u201d of change in this region, including melting sea ice, technological development, and global resource geopolitics; and although this discourse is far from new (Doel et al. 2014b), the end of the Cold War and the amplification of climate and global change have reframed the discussion (Christensen et al. 2013). The media has played a large role in propagating the \u201cdrivers\u201d discourse, usually understating the role of human agency. While recognizing that these \u201cdriving\u201d factors are important, this chapter will analyze some of this \u201cfuture-talk\u201d, in relation to the future of the Arctic. We would argue that there is considerable discursive power (Foucault 2002) in these images of the future, which explains why they are so visible and articulated with such fervor. It is not our intention to suggest that this talking about the future in and of itself constructs the future that actually unfolds. Rather, we hold that the genres of future-talk are closely connected to real interests connected to particular versions of Arctic futures.\n\n==\n\nKauppila 2022:\n\nTitle: China\u2019s rise and the Arctic region up to 2049 \u2013 three scenarios for regional futures in an era of climate change and power transition\n\nAbstract: ABSTRACT Although China has emerged as an increasingly influential global actor over recent decades, it is unclear whether a more fundamental transformation is shaking processes of regionalisation in this context. Our scenario-based case study considers the spatial reconfiguration of the rapidly globalising Arctic with varying degrees of Chinese engagement. More specifically, we examine alternative and transformational configurations of the Arctic in 2049, and ponder upon the plausibility of the hypothesised changes in light of three schools of thought on International Relations \u2013 realism, liberal institutionalism and relationalism. Hence, we explore how the rise of China could potentially alter the regional dynamics and whether, consequently, regions should be rethought both empirically and theoretically. We conclude that pluralistic discussion on the multiple regional outcomes is a necessary precondition for achieving a balanced and democratic future in the Arctic and beyond.", "final_summary": "The future of geopolitics, particularly in the Arctic region, is a complex and multifaceted issue. Scenario-building methodologies are increasingly being used to explore potential future developments in this rapidly changing region (Nilsson 2019; Erokhin 2020; Haavisto 2016; Keys 2021; Zaikov 2019; Brigham 2008; Wormbs 2017; Kauppila 2022).\n\nThe Arctic's future is influenced by a myriad of factors, including climate change, globalization, political shifts, and technological advancements (Zaikov 2019; Erokhin 2020; Haavisto 2016). These factors can lead to a variety of scenarios, from the Arctic becoming a hub of economic activity due to its mineral resources and strategic location (Erokhin 2020), to it remaining a relatively undeveloped region (Haavisto 2016).\n\nScenario-building exercises have been used to explore these potential futures. For instance, Nilsson (2019) emphasizes the need for participatory scenario methodologies that include diverse voices, particularly those of indigenous communities and youth. Similarly, Keys (2021) uses computational text analysis to generate unique thematic input for novel, story-based visions of the Arctic.\n\nHowever, these scenarios are not without their challenges. Erokhin (2020) notes the need for a systemic view in scenario-building exercises, particularly given the volatility of global geopolitical, geoeconomic, and environmental dynamics. Brigham (2008) also highlights the importance of considering the long-term impacts of key findings on Arctic Marine Navigation.\n\nIn conclusion, scenario-building methodologies provide a valuable tool for exploring the potential future of geopolitics in the Arctic.

Findings regarding the concurrent link between conflict resolution styles and marital satisfaction have been consistent in indicating that each spouse's marital satisfaction is positively related to the frequency with which each spouse uses constructive strategies to resolve conflict (such as agreement, compromise, and humor) and negatively related both to the frequency with which each spouse uses destructive strategies to resolve conflict (such as conflict engagement, withdrawal, and defensiveness) and to the joint frequency with which the wife uses conflict engagement and the husband uses withdrawal (the \"demand-withdraw\" pattern). This pattern of findings has been obtained regardless of whether conflict resolution styles were assessed by means of brief behavioral observations (Gottman & Krokoff, 1989; Heavey, Layne, & Christensen, 1993; Noller, Feeney, Bonnell, & Callan, 1994) or by means of self-report and partner-report questionnaire data (Christensen, 1988; Heavey et al., 1993; Huston & Vangelisti, 1991; Noller et al., 1994). Given that the concurrent link between conflict resolution styles and marital satisfaction is well-established, researchers have used longitudinal data to assess the plausibility of two causal relations involving conflict resolution styles and marital satisfaction. The first causal relation--the assumption that the use of certain conflict resolution styles causes marital satisfaction--is based on interdependence theory (Rusbult, 1983) which posits that perceived rewards to a relationship (such as the frequent use of constructive conflict resolution strategies) and perceived costs to the relationship (such as the frequent experience of negative conflict resolution styles) determine satisfaction with the relationship. The longitudinal data consistent with this causal relation would indicate that the frequency with which certain conflict resolution styles are used at Time 1 predicts change in marital satisfaction. The second causal relation--the assumption that the level of marital satisfaction is causally related to the frequency with which certain conflict resolution styles are used--is based on self-fulfilling prophecy theory (e.g., Snyder, Tanke, & Berscheid, 1977) which posits that one's attitude (e.g., level of satisfaction with the marriage) provides a psychological environment that elicits behavior (e.g., conflict resolution styles) that reinforces and is consistent with the initial attitude. The longitudinal data consistent with this causal relation would indicate that the level of marital satisfaction at Time 1 predicts the degree of change in the frequency with which certain conflict resolution styles are used. Unfortunately, longitudinal findings relevant to the plausibility of either causal relation have been inconsistent (Gottman & Krokoff, 1989; Heavey et al., 1993; Huston & Vangelisti, 1991; Noller et al., 1994). In part, this could be due to four methodological and two conceptual limitations of these studies. Regarding the methodological limitations, first, because Gottman and Krokoff (1989) and Heavey et al. (1993) used measures of marital satisfaction that also tapped frequency of conflict and disagreement, the correlations from these measures may have been inflated (see review by Fincham & Bradbury, 1987). Second, only Huston and Vangelisti (1991) reported that marital satisfaction scores changed appreciably over the time interval studied, raising the possibility that, in the other studies, a restriction of range accounted for nonsignificant findings. Third, because the first assessments made by Huston and Vangelisti (1991) and Noller et al. \u2026\n\n==\n\nGreeff 2000:\n\nTitle: Conflict management style and marital satisfaction.\n\nAbstract: The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is one conflict management style that correlated more significantly with marital satisfaction than any other.

Results showed that the collaborative conflict management style has the highest correlation with both marital satisfaction and spousal satisfaction with conflict management in the marriage.

However, in previous research, there has been little experimental control over the selection of topics. The present study examined, in a sample of 15 newlywed couples, whether affective displays during the discussion of a sexual and a nonsexual conflict topic differentially predict current marital satisfaction. Communication behaviors were coded using an adaptation of the Specific Affect Coding System, resulting in composite \u201cnegative behavior\u201d and \u201cpositive behavior\u201d categories. Data were analyzed using multilevel modeling. Negative behaviors displayed during the nonsexual conflict discussions were not significantly related to concurrent self-reported relationship satisfaction. In contrast, for wives, negative behaviors displayed during the discussion of a sexual problem were significantly related to lower levels of relationship satisfaction. For the sexual and nonsexual conflict discussions, positive behaviors were positively associated with relationship satisfaction, although this effect did not reach statistical significance. Overall, the authors\u2019 findings emphasize the importance of incorporating sexual variables in the study of marriage. Furthermore, their study represents an important step in recognizing that marital research benefits from an examination of specific topics of conflict as a factor to consider in studies of marital functioning.\n\n==\n\nSchudlich 2011:\n\nTitle: Relations between spouses' depressive symptoms and marital conflict: a longitudinal investigation of the role of conflict resolution styles.\n\nAbstract: This study investigated longitudinal relations between spouses' depressive symptoms and styles of conflict resolution displayed by husbands and wives in marital conflict, including angry, depressive, and constructive patterns of expression. Behavioral observations were made from a community sample of 276 couples during marital conflict resolution tasks once a year for 3 years. Couples were observed engaging in a major and minor conflict resolution task. Constructive, angry, and depressive conflict resolution styles were derived from the behavioral observation coding. Couples self-reported on depressive symptoms and marital dissatisfaction. Path analyses provided support for an extension of the marital discord model of depression (Beach, Sandeen, & O'Leary, 1990). Specifically, angry, depressive, and constructive styles of conflict each mediated the link between marital dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms. Significant cross-spouse effects were found.

By flexibly reducing the dimension of the parameter space, this can help to ensure regime separation and to detect the Markov switching nature of the data.

By extending the standard Markov switching model we decisively reject the martingale model. Moreover, the model generates autocorrelations and linear structures in line with what is observed in reality. Subsequently, we test whether this model can explain chartist profits. We find that the extended Markov switching model is able to explain the profitability of a simple MA-30 rule. Finally, we decompose the profitability of the MA-30 rule into a linear and nonlinear part. We find that, although the implied linear structure of the Markov model explains a substantial part of the profitability, part of the profits of the MA-30 rule can be attributed to the specific nonlinearities implicit in the Markov model.\n\n==\n\nGuidolin 2011:\n\nTitle: Markov Switching Models in Empirical Finance\n\nAbstract: I review the burgeoning literature on applications of Markov regime switching models in empirical finance.

Bivariate two state versions of the models are applied to a futures hedge of the S&P500. Regime switches occur between high and low cost of carry states via changes in the error correction term or basis. Regime identification is therefore dominated by switches in the mean, not volatility. Relative to a number of alternatives, the proposed models provide superior out of sample forecasts of the covariance matrix particularly for horizons greater than 10days ahead. When hedging, Markov switching with long memory improves the tail risk of hedged returns beyond 10day horizons, however there is mixed support for models with volatility asymmetries. These findings have important implications for the development of multivariate models and other applications including portfolio management, spread option pricing and arbitrage.\n\n==\n\nBauwens 2007:\n\nTitle: Theory and Inference for a Markov Switching GARCH Model\n\nAbstract: We develop a Markov-switching GARCH model (MS-GARCH) wherein the conditional mean and variance switch in time from one GARCH process to another.

Empirical results from commodity futures hedging show that MCSG creates hedging gains, compared with single-state-variable regime-switching GARCH models. Moreover, we find an average of 24% cross-regime probability, indicating the importance of modeling cross-regime dynamic in developing optimal futures hedging strategies. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is a very good vehicle for addressing some health related problems and also serve as security food. Cassava undergoes postharvest physiological deterioration (PPD) once the tubers are separated from the main plant. PPD is one of the main obstacles currently preventing farmers from exporting fresh cassava abroad thereby generating income from foreign exchange. Cassava can be preserved in various ways such as coating with wax and freezing. Recent development in plant breeding has resulted in cassava that is tolerant to PPD. Genetic manipulation was considered most appropriate to solving the PPD challenge by adding new traits to elite genotypes without altering other desired characteristics. Processing cassava affects the nutritional value of cassava roots through modification and losses in nutrients of high value. The processing methods include peeling, boiling, steaming, slicing, grating, soaking or seeping, fermenting, pounding, roasting, pressing, drying, and milling. The products from cassava are: High Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF), cassava chips, garri, starch, ethanol etc.\n\n==\n\nTaiwo 2006:\n\nTitle: Utilization Potentials of Cassava in Nigeria: The Domestic and Industrial Products\n\nAbstract: Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is an important food crop in the tropics\u2014a major carbohydrate staple consumed in various forms by humans. Furthermore, its usage as a source of ethanol for fuel, energy in animal feed, and starch for industry is increasing. Given that cassava represents a valuable subsistence and cash crop in many countries, its domestic and industrial potential needs to be fully exploited. Processing of cassava reduces the moisture content and converts it into a more durable and stable product. Women traditionally process cassava, although it could be processed at the small, medium, or industrial scale. This article discusses the major Nigerian domestic products as well as the potential industrial products of cassava that are yet to be produced locally and the machines used in their production. Although improved technology is one of the keys to increasing the productivity of micro-enterprises and generating broad-based, sustainable economic growth, the extent to which a given technology is acceptable to a given culture may depend on a number of considerations beyond the mechanical efficiency of the device.

Oyeronke Adejumo*, Adebayo Abass , Victor Okoruwa and Kabir Salman University of Ibadan; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture Abstract Food Security remains a major issue in the world today especially in developing countries. Availability and access to food are negatively affected by many factors, prominent of which is post-harvest loss. Minimizing post-harvest losses is thus a critical agricultural problem. Cassava, an important staple food and income earner in Nigeria and other parts of West Africa, is a perishable crop. Improved harvesting, better postharvest handling and optimized processing technologies are crucial for improving supply of cassava-based foods and income to smallholder processors. This study was carried out to examine the factors influencing the choice of post-harvest technologies used by cassava processors in the study area and assess the impact of improved technology on the processors income. Data were collected from 150 cassava processors in Kwara State, Nigeria using structured questionnaire and analyzed with multinomial logit model. Factors such as years of education, post-harvest technology capacity, processing experience, motives for processing, amongst others were found to influence the choice of post-harvest technologies used in the study area.

Numerous surgical techniques have been developed to address focal cartilage defects. Cartilage treatment strategies are characterized as palliation (eg, chondroplasty and debridement), repair (eg, drilling and microfracture [MF]), or restoration (eg, autologous chondrocyte implantation [ACI], osteochondral autograft [OAT], and osteochondral allograft [OCA]).

A loss of cartilage function and quality is also seen with increasing age. There is a spectrum of diseases ranging from focal cartilage defects with healthy surrounding cartilage to focal lesions in degenerative cartilage, to multiple and diffuse lesions in osteoarthritic cartilage. At the recent Aarhus Regenerative Orthopaedics Symposium (AROS) 2015, regenerative challenges in an ageing population were discussed by clinicians and basic scientists. A group of clinicians was given the task of discussing the role of tissue engineering in the treatment of degenerative cartilage lesions in ageing patients. We present the outcomes of our discussions on current treatment options for such lesions, with particular emphasis on different biological repair techniques and their supporting level of evidence. Results and interpretation \u2014 Based on the studies on treatment of degenerative lesions and early OA, there is low-level evidence to suggest that cartilage repair is a possible treatment for such lesions, but there are conflicting results regarding the effect of advanced age on the outcome. We concluded that further improvements are needed for direct repair of focal, purely traumatic defects before we can routinely use such repair techniques for the more challenging degenerative lesions. Furthermore, we need to identify trigger mechanisms that start generalized loss of cartilage matrix, and induce subchondral bone changes and concomitant synovial pathology, to maximize our treatment methods for biological repair in degenerative ageing joints.\n\n==\n\nSalzmann 2018:\n\nTitle: Articular Cartilage Repair of the Knee in Children and Adolescents\n\nAbstract: Articular cartilage predominantly serves a biomechanical function, which begins in utero and further develops during growth and locomotion. With regard to its 2-tissue structure (chondrocytes and matrix), the regenerative potential of hyaline cartilage defects is limited. Children and adolescents are increasingly suffering from articular cartilage and osteochondral deficiencies. Traumatic incidents often result in damage to the joint surfaces, while repetitive microtrauma may cause osteochondritis dissecans. When compared with their adult counterparts, children and adolescents have a greater capacity to regenerate articular cartilage defects. Even so, articular cartilage injuries in this age group may predispose them to premature osteoarthritis. Consequently, surgery is indicated in young patients when conservative measures fail. The operative techniques for articular cartilage injuries traditionally performed in adults may be performed in children, although an individualized approach must be tailored according to patient and defect characteristics. Clear guidelines for defect dimension\u2013associated techniques have not been reported. Knee joint dimensions must be considered and correlated with respect to the cartilage defect size. Particular attention must be given to the subchondral bone, which is frequently affected in children and adolescents. Articular cartilage repair techniques appear to be safe in this cohort of patients, and no differences in complication rates have been reported when compared with adult patients. Particularly, autologous chondrocyte implantation has good biological potential, especially for large-diameter joint surface defects.\n\n==\n\nGobbi 2011:\n\nTitle: One-Step Cartilage Repair with Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrated Cells and Collagen Matrix in Full-Thickness Knee Cartilage Lesions\n\nAbstract: Objective: The purpose of our study was to determine the effectiveness of cartilage repair utilizing 1-step surgery with bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) and a collagen I/III matrix (Chondro-Gide, Geistlich, Wolhusen, Switzerland). Materials and Methods: We prospectively followed up for 2 years 15 patients (mean age, 48 years) who were operated for grade IV cartilage lesions of the knee. Six of the patients had multiple chondral lesions; the average size of the lesions was 9.2 cm2. All patients underwent a mini-arthrotomy and concomitant transplantation with BMAC covered with the collagen matrix. Coexisting pathologies were treated before or during the same surgery. X-rays and MRI were collected preoperatively and at 1 and 2 years\u2019 follow-up. Visual analog scale (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm, Marx, SF-36 (physical/mental), and Tegner scores were collected preoperatively and at 6, 12, and 24 months\u2019 follow-up. Four patients gave their consent for second-look arthroscopy and 3 of them for a concomitant biopsy. Results: Patients showed significant improvement in all scores at final follow-up (P < 0.005).

Biopsies (n\u00a0=\u00a04) were harvested at 18\u201324\u00a0months after implantation and were analysed by histology and collagen type II immune staining.ResultsAt 1- and 2-year follow-up, the KOOS showed clinically meaningful and significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) improvement in all subcategories compared to baseline and to 3-month follow-up. There were no differences in KOOS data obtained after 2\u00a0years compared to 1\u00a0year after the treatment. Histological analysis of the biopsy tissue showed hyaline-like to hyaline cartilage repair tissue that was rich in cells with a chondrocyte morphology, proteoglycans and type II collagen.ConclusionsCovering of focal cartilage defects with the PGA-HA implant and PRP after bone marrow stimulation improves the patients\u2019 situation and has the potential to regenerate hyaline-like cartilage.Level of evidenceCase series, Level IV.\n\n==\n\nNiemeyer 2016:\n\nTitle: Cartilage repair surgery for full-thickness defects of the knee in Germany: indications and epidemiological data from the German Cartilage Registry (KnorpelRegister DGOU)\n\nAbstract: PurposeTreatment of cartilage defects of the knee remains an important issue with high relevance. In October 2013 the German Cartilage Registry (KnorpelRegister DGOU) was initiated in order to study indications, epidemiology and (clinical) outcome of different cartilage repair techniques. The present evaluation of the registry baseline data was initiated to report common practices of cartilage repair surgery in Germany.Materials and methods1065 consecutive patients who underwent surgical cartilage treatment of the knee have been included (complete data sets available in 1027 cases; FU rate 96.4\u00a0%) between October 1, 2013 and June 30, 2015. Data collection was performed using a web-based RDE System. All data were provided by the attending physician at the time of arthroscopic or open surgery of the affected knee.ResultsIn 1027 cartilage repair procedures, single defects were treated in 80\u00a0% of the cases with the majority of the defects located on the medial femoral condyle, followed by the patella. Degenerative defects grade III or IV according to ICRS were treated in 60\u00a0% of the cases and therefore were found more frequently compared to traumatic or post-traumatic lesions. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) was the most common technique followed by bone marrow stimulation (BMS) and osteochondral transplantation (OCT). While ACI was performed in defects with a mean size of 4.11\u00a0cm2 SD SD 2.16), BMS and OCT (1.51\u00a0cm2, SD 1.19; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) were applied in significantly smaller defects (both p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Independent of defect size, the ratio of ACI versus BMS applications differed between different defect locations. ACI was used preferably in defects located on the patella.ConclusionThe present analysis of data from the German Cartilage Registry shows that the vast majority of cartilage repair procedures were applied in degenerative, non-traumatic cartilage defects. Experts in Germany seem to follow the national and international guidelines in terms that bone marrow stimulation is applied in smaller cartilage defects while cell-based therapies are used for the treatment of larger cartilage defects.

In three spatial-cuing experiments (N = 60), we found that an onset cue captured attention both when it shared the target\u2019s color and when it did not. Yet the effects of the match between the response associated with the cued object\u2019s identity and the response associated with the target (compatibility effects), which are diagnostic of attentional engagement, were observed only with relevant-color onset cues. These findings demonstrate that stimulus- and goal-driven capture have qualitatively different consequences: Before attention is reoriented to the target, it is engaged to the location of the critical distractor following goal-driven capture but not stimulus-driven capture. The reported dissociation between attentional shifts and attentional engagement suggests that attention is best described as a camera: One can align its zoom lens without pressing the shutter button.\n\n==\n\nBecker 2020:\n\nTitle: The attentional blink: A relational accountof attentional engagement\n\nAbstract: Visual attention allows selecting relevant information from cluttered visual scenes and is largely determined by our ability to tune or bias visual attention to goal-relevant objects. Originally, it was believed that this top-down bias operates on the specific feature values of objects (e.g., tuning attention to orange). However, subsequent studies showed that attention is tuned to in a context-dependent manner to the relative feature of a sought-after object (e.g., the reddest or yellowest item), which drives covert attention and eye movements in visual search. However, the evidence for the corresponding relational account is still limited to the orienting of spatial attention. The present study tested whether the relational account can be extended to explain attentional engagement and specifically, the attentional blink (AB) in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. In two blocked conditions, observers had to identify an orange target letter that could be either redder or yellower than the other letters in the stream. In line with previous work, a target-matching (orange) distractor presented prior to the target produced a robust AB. Extending on prior work, we found an equally large AB in response to relatively matching distractors that matched only the relative color of the target (i.e., red or yellow; depending on whether the target was redder or yellower). Unrelated distractors mostly failed to produce a significant AB. These results closely match previous findings assessing spatial attention and show that the relational account can be extended to attentional engagement and selection of continuously attended objects in time.\n\n==\n\nOakes 2004:\n\nTitle: Attentional Engagement in Infancy: The Interactive Influence of Attentional Inertia and Attentional State.\n\nAbstract: We evaluated the interactive influences of attentional state and attentional inertia on infants' level of attentional engagement. We assessed infants' distraction latencies longitudinally at 6.5 and 9 months as they explored toys, and we coded both their attentional state (focused vs. casual) and how long they had been looking at the toy at each distractor onset. Consistent with previous results, both attentional state and attentional inertia contributed to differences in distraction latency. Importantly, the level of attentional engagement was interactively determined by attentional state and attentional inertia. Infants were most resistant to distraction when they were judged to be in a state of focused attention following relatively long looks to the toy, and they were equivalently less resistant to distraction under all other conditions. These results are consistent with a general conceptualization of attentional engagement resulting from the interaction of multiple processes.\n\n==\n\nAbuhamdeh 2012:\n\nTitle: Attentional involvement and intrinsic motivation\n\nAbstract: The current study used the Experience Sampling Method to examine attentional involvement\u2014the degree to which one\u2019s attention is devoted to moment-to-moment activity\u2014as a potential mediator of two previously identified relationships within the field of intrinsic motivation: (1) the positive relationship between a balance of challenges and skills and enjoyment, and (2) the positive relationship between competence valuation and enjoyment. Multilevel, within-person analyses indicated attentional involvement fully mediated both relationships. Implications of the findings for intrinsic motivation processes are discussed.\n\n==\n\nZivony 2020:\n\nTitle: Distractor intrusions are the result of delayed attentional engagement: A new temporal variability account of attentional selectivity in dynamic visual tasks.\n\nAbstract: When observers must identify targets among distractors in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream, distractor intrusion errors are frequent, demonstrating the difficulty of allocating attention to the right object at the right moment in time. However, the mechanisms responsible for such intrusion errors remain disputed. We propose a new attentional engagement account of selective visual processing in RSVP tasks. Engagement is triggered by the preattentive detection of target-defining features. Critically, the success versus failure of target identification is determined by the speed of such engagement processes on individual trials. To test this account, we measured electrophysiological markers of attentional engagement (N2pc components) in 3 experiments where observers had to report the identity of a target digit in 1 of 2 lateral RSVP streams. On most trials, the target was immediately followed by a digit distractor, resulting in many posttarget distractor intrusions. Critically, N2pcs components measured on distractor intrusion trials were significantly delayed relative to trials with correct target reports. This was the case regardless of whether the target was defined by a shape cue or by its color and even when the location of shape-defined targets was known in advance. These findings show that distractor intrusions are the result of delayed attentional engagement. They demonstrate that temporal variability in attentional selectivity across trials can strongly affect visual awareness and perceptual reports. Our temporal variability account of attentional engagement offers a new framework for assessing the temporal dynamics of attention in visual object recognition.

While various approaches to improve attentional engagement exist, it is difficult to produce an effect in younger people, due to the inadequate attraction of these approaches themselves. Here, we show that a single 30-min engagement with an attention restoration theory (ART)-inspired closed-loop software program (Virtual ART) delivered on a consumer-friendly virtual reality head-mounted display (VR-HMD) could lead to improvements in both general attention level and the depth of engagement in young university students. These improvements were associated with positive changes in both behavioral (response time and response time variability) and key electroencephalography (EEG)-based neural metrics (frontal midline theta inter-trial coherence and parietal event-related potential P3b). All the results were based on the comparison of the standard Virtual ART tasks (control group, n = 15) and closed-loop Virtual ART tasks (treatment group, n = 15). This study provides the first case of EEG evidence of a VR-HMD-based closed-loop ART intervention generating enhanced attentional engagement.\n\n==\n\nPerra 2012:\n\nTitle: Attention engagement in early infancy.\n\nAbstract: We report a longitudinal study investigating developmental changes in the structure of attention engagement during early infancy. Forty-three infants were observed monthly from 2 to 4 months. Attention engagement was assessed from play interactions with parents, using a coding system developed by Bakeman and Adamson (1984). The results indicated a developmental transition in attention engagement at 3 months: after this age infants engaged for longer periods and in a wider variety of states. Most infants displayed person engagement at 2 months, passive joint engagement at 3 months, and object engagement at 4 months. To address whether emerging abilities of attention engagement allow infants to follow the attention of social partners, we compared attention engagement to performance on an experimental measure of attention control (reported by Perra & Gattis, 2010). Analyses revealed a positive relation between passive joint engagement and checking back, suggesting that changes in passive joint engagement reflect the development in attention control.\n\n==\n\nBrockmole 2009:\n\nTitle: Should I stay or should I go? Attentional disengagement from visually unique and unexpected items at fixation.\n\nAbstract: Distinctive aspects of a scene can capture attention even when they are irrelevant to one's goals. The authors address whether visually unique, unexpected, but task-irrelevant features also tend to hold attention. Observers searched through displays in which the color of each item was irrelevant. At the start of search, all objects changed color. Critically, the foveated item changed to an unexpected color (it was novel), became a color singleton (it was unique), or both. Saccade latency revealed the time required to disengage overt attention from this object. Singletons resulted in longer latencies, but only if they were unexpected. Conversely, unexpected items only delayed disengagement if they were singletons. Thus, the time spent overtly attending to an object is determined, at least in part, by task-irrelevant stimulus properties, but this depends on the confluence of expectation and visual salience.", "final_summary": "Attentional engagement, a captivating area of study, refers to the degree to which one's attention is devoted to moment-to-moment activity.

His personality becomes an example of how family and social environment contribute to the development of one\u2019s personality. The research method used in understanding and in analysing the novel was descriptive qualitative. The research results are: According to Erik Erikson\u2019s eight stages in psychosocial development theory, Theo has passed four major stages they are the stages of initiative vs guilt (14%), industry vs inferiority (14%), identity vs role confusion (46%), and intimacy vs isolation (29%). Theo struggles to pass the stage of identity vs role confusion. It has led him to the situation where he faces difficulties on understanding his identity and role within society. Theo is grown up as a person with less empathy for others, struggles with his drug addiction, and has trouble making commitments; Erik Erikson\u2019s psychosocial development of the personality emphasizes the social influences in the development of the ego. Erikson\u2019s theory of psychosocial development has eight distinct stages. Completing each step results in a healthy personality and the acquisition of the ego to resolve subsequent crises. Conversely, failure to complete a set will lead to ability reduction in completing further stages and an unhealthier personality and sense of self.

In the course of this thesis certain observations have emerged. Change occurs in the context of a relationship intense enough to disturb the tendency of personality to homeostasis (engagement). The change-inducing relationship is composed of a sequence of effects and countereffects (mutual influence). For these influences to be salutory (therapeutic) there must be a directional pull provided by the attitude of the primary agent of change, a pull that resonates with important motivations of the object of change (directionality). In Pride and Prejudice we recurrently found self-concept, and particularly the question of worth, to be an important interface of these phenomena. As therapists we are familiar with this as a clinical issue. Study of the novel suggests that self-esteem may play a central role in motivating therapeutic change. This observation raises intriguing unanswered questions regarding the conceptualization of self-esteem in psychoanalytic thinking.\n\n==\n\nHalperin 1996:\n\nTitle: Writing Great Characters : The Psychology of Character Development in Screenplays\n\nAbstract: This valuable book identifies and solves a major problem for writers - creating characters who are so real they literally jump of the page.

The volume draws from personality and developmental research as well as educational and ethical theory. Character Psychology and Character Education distinguishes itself by bringing moral philosophers, who believe that ethical reflection about virtue and character must be tied to defensible notions of personality and selfhood, into dialogue with academic psychologists, who believe that the developmental study of the moral self requires adequate grounding in various psychological literatures. The first group embraces a \"naturalized\" ethics, while the second group favors a \"psychologized\" morality. Among the topics explored in this volume are the constructs of moral selfhood, personality, and identity, as well as defensible models of character education. One of the primary arguments of the volume is that problems of character education cannot be addressed until an adequate model of character psychology is developed. In addition to the excellent theoretical essays, this collection includes applied chapters that consider the challenge of character education in the context of schools, families, and organized sports.

From this perspective, character development is an illusion, an impossibility, or both. We offer a different interpretation of how these issues interact with character development concerns. Rather than undermining the very idea of character traits, social psychology actually sheds light on the manner in which character development can occur. It reaffirms Spinozistic and Aristotelian points about character, namely that: (1) knowledge of the fundamental attribution error can help us minimize the influence environment and situation have on our behaviour, and (2) proper habituation only takes place in appropriately structured environments. Acknowledging these important results from social psychology helps us improve some of our character education practices rather than destroying their basis.\n\n==\n\nUtami 2013:\n\nTitle: The Psychological Changes of a Main Character in a Novel A Walk To Remember by Nicholas Sparks\n\nAbstract: Literature is a field in which most of the human\u2019s life is included on it.

The desired step is controlled by high-level goals, namely step position and step duration. These stepping goals guide the desired time-varying values for the center of mass and the stepping foot which in turn lead to objectives dictating the desired changes in momentum and joint angles over the duration of the step. Our approach employs a multiobjective optimization to solve for joint accelerations from the objectives and uses inverse dynamics to compute joint torques. Our approach can guide a character with purposeful, directable steps for controlling careful navigation of the character's position and orientation. In addition, the same system can be used to create protective steps to prevent falling as a reaction to a disturbance. A novel supervisory routine automatically chooses when and where to step based on an analysis of the momentum conditions for the character. We contrast this approach to previous methods for step recovery using the inverted pendulum.\n\n==\n\nShoham 1985:\n\nTitle: Naive Kinematics: One Aspect of Shape\n\nAbstract: Ways in which physical objects interact are explored, and in particular the concept of freedom is analysed.

Majority of patients with pleural malignant mesothelioma present with unresectable disease. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is one of erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (TK) known to play a critical role in the cell proliferation and survival in malignant neoplasms. Several studies have reported an increased expression of EGFR in mesothelioma. EGFR-expressing mesothelioma cell lines seemed to be sensitive to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.1 After these observations, the Cancer and Leukemia Study Group B conducted a phase II trial of gefitinib, an EGFR TK inhibitor in 43 previously untreated patients with mesothelioma.2 Of the 28 samples tested for EGFR expression, 27 (97%) had an overexpression of EGFR. Despite EGFR overexpression, gefitinib was not active in malignant mesothelioma. EGFR expression is not an independent prognostic factor in patients with mesothelioma.2,3 There is a striking discordance between EGFR expression and lack of response to EGFR TK inhibitors in malignant mesothelioma. Mutations in exons 18\u201321 of the EGFR are associated with response to EGFR TK inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer. There are only limited data on the prevalence of EGFR TK mutations in mesothelioma. We sought to investigate the presence of any EGFR mutations in our patients with mesothelioma. A total of 32 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of mesothelioma seen at the Washington University School of Medicine were included in this study. DNA samples were obtained from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks containing representative malignant cells. High-throughput (96well plate) bidirectional dideoxynucleotide sequencing of polymerase chain reactionamplified gene products was performed at the Genome Sequencing Center (Washington University in St. Louis) as per standard protocol http://genome.wustl. edu/activity/med_seq/protocols.cgi. Exonic regions 18 \u201321, including the exon/intron boundaries of EGFR (Entrez GeneID 2065) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The sequence traces were assembled and scanned for variations from the reference sequence through the use of PolyPhred and PolyScan. All detailed protocols and primer sequences are available through the Washington University School of Medicine GSC website (http://genome.wustl. edu/platforms.cgi?id 7). After sequencing the DNA from the 32 mesothelioma samples, we found no evidence of mutations in our set of patients with mesothelioma. Our findings are consistent with the three earlier published studies.3\u20135 We further confirm the findings that although increased expression of EGFR is common in patients with mesothelioma, mutations of the EGFR kinase region commonly occurring in non-small cell lung cancer seem to be uncommon in mesothelioma. Lack of activating mutations in the EGFR TK domain may explain the inactivity of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in mesothelioma.\n\n==\n\nItakura 1994:\n\nTitle: Epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression in esophageal carcinoma.

All malignant mesotheliomas and non-neoplastic pleural biopsies exhibited a strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in mesothelial cells. Nuclear immunoreactivity was detected in mesothelial cells of all specimens of both malignant and non-neoplastic pleura. No statistically significant differences were found between malignant mesothelioma and non-neoplastic pleural mesothelium. There were differences, between the three subtypes of mesothelioma, in the number of cells that exhibited nuclear staining. Statistically significant differences were noted between the epithelial subtype and the mesenchymal subtype (P< 0.005), epithelial subtype versus the mixed cell type (P< 0.005) and between the mesenchymal component of the mixed cell type and the mesenchymal type (P<0.0005). We conclude that there is strong expression of EGF receptor in both malignant mesothelioma and in non-neoplastic pleural mesothelium. Different staining patterns are seen when comparing the different subtypes of mesotheliomas with each other. EGF receptor expression cannot be used to distinguish between malignant and benign mesothelium.\n\n==\n\nPalm\u00e9r 1999:\n\nTitle: Epidermal growth factor receptor ligands are chemoattractants for normal human mesothelial cells.\n\nAbstract: Signalling through epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor leads to several cellular responses including cell division and cell migration. Since EGF receptors are expressed on normal mesothelial cells, this study investigated whether EGF receptor ligands act as chemoattractants on these cells. The study used Boyden chambers fitted with filters coated with the adhesive matrix proteins fibronectin, laminin, collagen type IV and the nonmatrix adhesive molecule poly-L-lysine, for the migration studies. Normal mesothelial cells migrated to EGF receptor ligands such as EGF, transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) at concentrations ranging 0.024-100 ng x mL(-1) (with a peak stimulation at 6.25 ng x mL(-1)), if matrix proteins were present as adhesive substrates. This migration was integrin-dependent, since the same cells failed to migrate in the absence of extracellular matrix molecules or when the Boyden chamber assay was performed in the presence of anti-beta1 integrin monoclonal antibodies. These findings describe for the first time epidermal growth factor receptor ligands acting as chemoattractants on normal mesothelial cells, and that signalling through epidermal growth factor receptors leading to mesothelial cell migration also requires the activation of integrins.\n\n==\n\nGill 1987:\n\nTitle: Epidermal growth factor and its receptor\n\nAbstract: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds with high affinity and specificity to a single site on the external domain of its transmembrane receptor to activate the tyrosine protein kinase activity of its cytoplasmic portion. The EGF receptor gene is amplified and over-expressed in several human tumors, suggesting that increased concentrations of the proto-oncogene leads to constitutive activity similar to that seen with oncogene erb B. Synthesis and degradation of the EGF receptor are regulated, in addition, covalent modification by phosphorylation regulates activity of the receptor protein. Intramolecular self-phosphorylation of Tyr1173 removes a competitive inhibitory constraint to enhance phosphorylation of substrates. Phosphorylation of Thr654 by protein kinase C decreases high affinity EGF binding and EGF-stimulated tyrosine protein kinase activity, providing a mechanism for heterologous regulation of the EGF receptor by tumor promoters and other ligand X receptor complexes. Extensive regulation contributes to normal growth control, abrogation of regulatory controls contributes to uncontrolled growth as seen with erb B transformation and EGF receptor gene amplification in human tumors.\n\n==\n\nClark 1985:\n\nTitle: Epidermal growth factor regulates the expression of its own receptor.\n\nAbstract: The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor gene is the cellular homolog of the avian erythroblastosis virus erbB oncogene. Control of EGF receptor expression determines cellular responsiveness to EGF and might play an important role in neoplastic development. Using RNA blot hybridization, we have found that exposure of human KB carcinoma cells to EGF results in elevated levels of EGF receptor mRNA. The phorbol ester 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also stimulates EGF receptor RNA accumulation. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled (30 min) EGF receptor protein revealed that synthesis of new EGF receptor follows the increase in receptor RNA. Addition of cycloheximide together with EGF further enhances EGF receptor RNA accumulation. Results of nuclear runoff-transcription experiments suggest that the stimulatory effects of EGF and cycloheximide are most likely due to a posttranscriptional control mechanism.\n\n==\n\nGreen 1983:\n\nTitle: Distribution and number of epidermal growth factor receptors in skin is related to epithelial cell growth.\n\nAbstract: Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a low-molecular-weight polypeptide (G. Carpenter and S. Cohen, 1979, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 48, 193-216), stimulates the proliferation and keratinisation of cultured embryonic epidermis (S. Cohen, 1965, Dev. Biol. 12, 394-407) and promotes epidermal growth, thickening, and keratinisation when injected into neonatal mice (S. Cohen and G.A. Elliott, 1963, J. Invest. Dermatol, 40, 1-5). We have determined the distribution of the available receptors for epidermal growth factor in rat skin using autoradiography following incubation of explants with 125I-labelled mouse EGF. EGF receptors are detected on the epithelial cells overlying the basement membranes of the epidermis, sebaceous gland, and regions of the hair follicle all of which have proliferative capacity. In marked contrast, tissues which have started to differentiate and lost their growth potential, carry either an undetectable or sharply reduced number of EGF receptors. The EGF receptor number and receptor affinity of epidermal basal cells freshly isolated from rats of increasing age has also been determined. We find that receptor affinity remains unchanged (3.3 nM) but that basal cell surface receptor number decreases markedly with age. This decrease in receptor number is similar in trend to the known drop in basal cell [3H]thymidine labelling index which occurs over the same time period. The data suggest that the distribution of EGF receptors and EGF cell surface receptor number in skin are important in the spatial and temporal control of epithelial proliferation.", "final_summary": "The research question \"epidermal growth factor receptors overexpression mesothelium\" has been addressed in several studies. \n\nRena (2011) evaluated the phenotypic expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and its correlation with patients' prognosis.

This information can further enhance many downstream tasks in the field of information retrieval and natural language processing; however, improvements in multi-modal techniques and their performance evaluation require large-scale multi-modal data which offers sufficient diversity. Multi-lingual modeling for a variety of tasks like multi-modal summarization, text generation, and translation leverages information derived from high-quality multi-lingual annotated data. In this work, we present the current largest multi-lingual multi-modal summarization dataset (M3LS), and it consists of over a million instances of document-image pairs along with a professionally annotated multi-modal summary for each pair. It is derived from news articles published by British Broadcasting Corporation(BBC) over a decade and spans 20 languages, targeting diversity across five language roots, it is also the largest summarization dataset for 13 languages and consists of cross-lingual summarization data for 2 languages. We formally define the multi-lingual multi-modal summarization task utilizing our dataset and report baseline scores from various state-of-the-art summarization techniques in a multi-lingual setting.

These issues are addressed by automatic text summarizing techniques, which condense lengthy texts while preserving their key information. Thus, the development of automatic summarization systems capable of fulfilling the ever-increasing demands of textual data becomes of utmost importance. It is even more vital with complex natural languages. This study explores five State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Arabic deep Transformer-based Language Models (TLMs) in the task of text summarization by adapting various text summarization datasets dedicated to Arabic. A comparison against deep learning and machine learning-based baseline models has also been conducted. Experimental results reveal the superiority of TLMs, specifically the PEAGASUS family, against the baseline approaches, with an average F1-score of 90% on several benchmark datasets.\n\n==\n\nVarab 2021:\n\nTitle: MassiveSumm: a very large-scale, very multilingual, news summarisation dataset\n\nAbstract: Current research in automatic summarisation is unapologetically anglo-centered\u2013a persistent state-of-affairs, which also predates neural net approaches. High-quality automatic summarisation datasets are notoriously expensive to create, posing a challenge for any language. However, with digitalisation, archiving, and social media advertising of newswire articles, recent work has shown how, with careful methodology application, large-scale datasets can now be simply gathered instead of written. In this paper, we present a large-scale multilingual summarisation dataset containing articles in 92 languages, spread across 28.8 million articles, in more than 35 writing scripts. This is both the largest, most inclusive, existing automatic summarisation dataset, as well as one of the largest, most inclusive, ever published datasets for any NLP task. We present the first investigation on the efficacy of resource building from news platforms in the low-resource language setting. Finally, we provide some first insight on how low-resource language settings impact state-of-the-art automatic summarisation system performance.\n\n==\n\nLiu 2014:\n\nTitle: Enhanced language modeling for extractive speech summarization with sentence relatedness information\n\nAbstract: Extractive summarization is intended to automatically select a set of representative sentences from a text or spoken document that can concisely express the most important topics of the document. Language modeling (LM) has been proven to be a promising framework for performing extractive summarization in an unsupervised manner. However, there remain two fundamental challenges facing existing LM-based methods. One is how to construct sentence models involved in the LM framework more accurately without resorting to external information sources. The other is how to additionally take into account the sentence-level structural relationships embedded in a document for important sentence selection. To address these two challenges, in this paper we explore a novel approach that generates overlapped clusters to extract sentence relatedness information from the document to be summarized, which can be used not only to enhance the estimation of various sentence models but also to allow for the sentencelevel structural relationships for better summarization performance. Further, the utilities of our proposed methods and several state-of-the-art unsupervised methods are analyzed and compared extensively. A series of experiments conducted on a Mandarin broadcast news summarization task demonstrate the effectiveness and viability of our method.\n\n==\n\nPerez-Beltrachini 2022:\n\nTitle: Models and Datasets for Cross-Lingual Summarisation\n\nAbstract: We present a cross-lingual summarisation corpus with long documents in a source language associated with multi-sentence summaries in a target language.

We derive cross-lingual document-summary instances from Wikipedia by combining lead paragraphs and articles\u2019 bodies from language aligned Wikipedia titles. We analyse the proposed cross-lingual summarisation task with automatic metrics and validate it with a human study. To illustrate the utility of our dataset we report experiments with multi-lingual pre-trained models in supervised, zero- and few-shot, and out-of-domain scenarios.\n\n==\n\nLi 2016:\n\nTitle: GuideRank: A Guided Ranking Graph Model for Multilingual Multi-document Summarization\n\nAbstract: Multilingual multi-document summarization is a task to generate the summary in target language from a collection of documents in multiple source languages. A straightforward approach to this task is automatically translating the non-target language documents into target language and then applying monolingual summarization methods, but the summaries generated by this method is often poorly readable due to the low quality of machine translation. To solve this problem, we propose a novel graph model based on guided edge weighting method in which both informativeness and readability of summaries are taken into consideration fully. In methodology, our model attempts to choose from the target language documents the sentences which contain important shared information across languages, and also retains the salient sentences which cannot be covered by documents in other language. The experimental results on our manually labeled dataset (It will be released to the public.) show that our method significantly outperforms other baseline methods.\n\n==\n\nLawrie 2003:\n\nTitle: Language models for hierarchical summarization\n\nAbstract: Hierarchies have long been used for organization, summarization, and access to information. In this dissertation we define summarization in terms of a probabilistic language model and use this definition to explore a new technique for automatically generating topic hierarchies. We use the language model to characterize the documents that will be summarized and then apply a graph-theoretic algorithm to determine the best topic words for the hierarchical summary. This work is very different from previous attempts to generate topic hierarchies because it relies on statistical analysis and language modeling to identify descriptive words for a document and organize the words in a hierarchical structure. \nWe compare our new technique to previous methods proposed for constructing topic hierarchies, including subsumption and lexical hierarchies. We also compare the words chosen to be part of the hierarchy to the top ranked words using TF.IDF in terms of how well each summarizes the document set. Our results show that the language modeling approach performs as well as or better than these other techniques in non user-based evaluations. We also show that the hierarchies provide better access to the documents described in the summary than does a ranked list using one of the non-user based evaluations we have developed. In a user study that compares the ability of users to find relevant instances using both the hierarchy and a ranked list to using the ranked list alone, we find that users like the information provided by the hierarchy and after some practice can use it as effectively as they can a ranked list.\n\n==\n\nSingh 2018:\n\nTitle: Long-Span Language Models for Query-Focused Unsupervised Extractive Text Summarization\n\nAbstract: Effective unsupervised query-focused extractive summarization systems use query-specific features along with short-range language models (LMs) in sentence ranking and selection summarization subtasks. We hypothesize that applying long-span n-gram-based and neural LMs that better capture larger context can help improve these subtasks. Hence, we outline the first attempt to apply long-span models to a query-focused summarization task in an unsupervised setting. We also propose the A cross S entence B oundary LSTM-based LMs, ASB LSTM and bi ASB LSTM, that is geared towards the query-focused summarization subtasks. Intrinsic and extrinsic experiments on a real word corpus with 100 Wikipedia event descriptions as queries show that using the long-span models applied in an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of MMR criterion are the most effective against several state-of-the-art baseline methods from the literature.", "final_summary": "The research question \"information summarization large language models\" has been addressed in various ways across the selected papers. \n\nVerma (2023) introduced a large-scale multi-lingual multi-modal summarization dataset, M3LS, which is derived from news articles published by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) over a decade and spans 20 languages.

Inspired by French et al. (1987) and Bollerslev et al. (1988), who maintain that future asset returns are also influenced by past volatility, we use daily volatilities and returns from financial and commodity markets to generate real out-of-sample forecasts for the monthly oil futures prices. Our results convincingly show that although the oil market fundamentals are useful for long-run forecasting horizons, the combination of the latter with high-frequency financial data significantly improve oil price forecasts, by reducing the RMSE of the no-change forecast by approximately 68%. Results are even more impressive during the oil price collapse period of 2014\u201315. These findings suggest that we cannot ignore the information extracted from the financial markets when forecasting oil prices. Our results are both statistically and economically significant, as suggested by several robustness tests.\n\n==\n\nYanagisawa 2009:\n\nTitle: Usefulness of the Forward Curve in Forecasting Oil Prices\n\nAbstract: When people analyse oil prices, the forward curve is often referred to as it reflects the average view among market participants. In this paper, to what extent the forward curve provides useful information in forecasting oil prices was analysed quantitatively. Although the usefulness of the forward curve is confirmed in forecasting oil prices, the effect in reducing forecast error is small. Additionally, the forward curve is actually useful for one week ahead and for one month ahead in daily and weekly forecasts, respectively. However, the forward curve is scarcely useful in long-term forecast.\n\n==\n\nBaumeister 2012:\n\nTitle: What Central Bankers Need to Know About Forecasting Oil Prices\n\nAbstract: Recent research has shown that recursive real-time VAR forecasts of the real price of oil tend to be more accurate than forecasts based on oil futures prices of the type commonly employed by central banks worldwide. Such monthly forecasts, however, differ in several important dimensions from the forecasts central banks require when making policy decisions. First, central banks are interested in forecasts of the quarterly real price of oil rather than forecasts of the monthly real price of oil. Second, many central banks are interested in forecasting the real price of Brent crude oil rather than any of the U.S. benchmarks. Third, central banks outside the United States are interested in forecasting the real price of oil measured in domestic consumption units rather than U.S. consumption units. Addressing each of these three concerns involves modeling choices that affect the relative accuracy of alternative forecasting methods. In addition, we investigate the costs and benefits of allowing for time variation in VAR model parameters and of constructing forecast combinations. We conclude that quarterly forecasts of the real price of oil from suitably designed VAR models estimated on monthly data generate the most accurate forecasts among a wide range of methods including forecasts based on oil futures prices, nochange forecasts and forecasts based on models estimated on quarterly data.\n\n==\n\nAmin-Naseri 2007:\n\nTitle: A Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Approach to Monthly Forecasting of Crude Oil Price Time Series\n\nAbstract: Due to the important role of crude oil in the global economy, oil price is a key factor affecting economic plans and decisions of governments and commercial firms. Therefore, proactive knowledge of its future movements can lead to better decisions in various governmental and managerial levels. However, oil price forecasting with a satisfying accuracy has proved to be a difficult task because of the complex underlying mechanism governing oil price evolution. This paper proposes a hybrid artificial intelligence model for monthly crude oil price forecasting by means of feed-forward neural networks, genetic algorithm and k-means clustering. In order to evaluate the performance of the model, its forecasts are compared with those of the econometric model of Energy Information Administration as the best representative of econometric models, as well as three artificial intelligence models from the literature. Results show that our proposed model outperforms the above mentioned models.\n\n==\n\nZhang 2019:\n\nTitle: Do high-frequency stock market data help forecast crude oil prices? Evidence from the MIDAS models\n\nAbstract: Extensive studies have used stock market information to forecast crude oil prices, and stock market can more easily derive high-frequency data than crude oil market due to no revisions, which raises a question that whether high-frequency stock market data can improve the forecast performance of crude oil prices. Therefore, this paper employs the MIDAS model and the high-frequency data of four stock market indices to forecast WTI and Brent crude oil prices at lower frequency. The results indicate that the high-frequency stock market indices have certain advantage over the lower-frequency data in forecasting monthly crude oil prices, and the MIDAS model using high-frequency data proves superior to the ordinary model.\n\n==\n\nBaumeister 2013:\n\nTitle: Forecasting the Real Price of Oil in a Changing World: A Forecast Combination Approach\n\nAbstract: The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) regularly publishes monthly and quarterly forecasts of the price of crude oil for horizons up to 2 years, which are widely used by practitioners. Traditionally, such out-of-sample forecasts have been largely judgmental, making them difficult to replicate and justify. An alternative is the use of real-time econometric oil price forecasting models. We investigate the merits of constructing combinations of six such models. Forecast combinations have received little attention in the oil price forecasting literature to date. We demonstrate that over the last 20 years suitably constructed real-time forecast combinations would have been systematically more accurate than the no-change forecast at horizons up to 6 quarters or 18 months. The MSPE reductions may be as high as 12% and directional accuracy as high as 72%. The gains in accuracy are robust over time. In contrast, the EIA oil price forecasts not only tend to be less accurate than no-change forecasts, but are much less accurate than our preferred forecast combination. Moreover, including EIA forecasts in the forecast combination systematically lowers the accuracy of the combination forecast. We conclude that suitably constructed forecast combinations should replace traditional judgmental forecasts of the price of oil.\n\n==\n\nChatziantoniou 2019:\n\nTitle: Futures-based forecasts: How useful are they for oil price volatility forecasting?\n\nAbstract: Oil price volatility forecasts have recently attracted the attention of many studies in the energy finance field. The literature mainly concentrates its attention on the use of daily data, using GARCH-type models. It is only recently that efforts to use more informative intraday data to forecast oil price realized volatility have been made. Despite all these previous efforts, no study has examined the usefulness of futures-based models for oil price realized volatility forecasting, although the use of such models is extensive for oil price predictions. This study fills this void and shows that futures-based forecasts based on intra-day data provide informative forecasts for horizons that span between 1-day and 66-days ahead. More importantly, these results hold true even during turbulent times for the oil market, such as the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-09 and the oil collapse period of 2014-15.\n\n==\n\nDelis 2021:\n\nTitle: What matters when developing oil price volatility forecasting frameworks\n\nAbstract: Forecasting oil price volatility is considered of major importance for numerous stakeholders, including, policy makers, industries and investors. This paper examines and evaluates the main factors that oil price volatility forecasters should take before constructing their forecasting models. Such factors are related to: i) direct vs iterated forecasts, ii) the incorporation of continuous and jump components, iii) the importance of semi variance volatility measures, and iv) OLS vs time-varying parameter (TVP) estimation procedures. Even more, we evaluate the performance of these factors for both realized and implied volatility measures, based on statistical loss functions, as well \nas, their economic use. The results show that depending on whether end-users are interested in forecasting the realized or the implied volatility, the factors influencing the accuracy of forecasts are different. In particular, for the realized volatility, direct forecasting based on TVP estimation procedure, as well as, using the information obtained in the semi variance measures are capable of producing significantly superior forecasts. By contrast, separating the continuous and the jump components of the realized volatility does not provide any added value to these forecasts. Turning to the OVX, based on the economic evaluation of our forecasts, the TVP estimation procedure \nseems to performbetter. In addition, we find evidence that the continuous component and the semi variance measures of the realized volatility also yield better OVX forecasts in the longer run horizons.", "final_summary": "Forecasting oil prices is a critical endeavor with far-reaching implications for various stakeholders.

Within this term, we generally refer to those that are active against the latter. They are divided into antiseptics and antibiotics. Antiseptics are directly applied to a living organism to eradicate the existing microorganism on the mucocutaneous surfaces, preventing their proliferation. Topical antibiotics are either produced by living organisms or manufactured through synthesis and are mainly used to fight infections. Topical antimicrobials represent an important option in the prophylaxis and treatment of primary and secondary superficial bacterial infections. Antibiotics for topical use have a lower incidence of systemic toxicity, secondary effects and development of resistance than parenteral antibiotics. The ideal topical antimicrobial must have a broad spectrum of activity, fast and prolonged antibacterial effect, bactericidal activity, easy diffusion through tissues and detritus, with minimal toxicity, very low or null incidence of irritation or allergy and sparse activity against normal skin flora. The approach of this article is the description of the classical and new antimicrobials that are, more important due to their wide use and proven efficacy. We review their pharmacological characteristics, spectrum of activity, possible secondary effects and interactions, as well as the combinations that improve their antimicrobial activity, main indications and possible development of resistance, all this properly documented.\n\n==\n\n\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e4\u3001\u30a2\u30ca\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30b1\u30fc 2006:\n\nTitle: Topical compositions and the use thereof\n\nAbstract: Suitable for topical application to the skin, in a composition comprising a fugitive solvent base comprising at least one alcohol, to provide an emollient component.

Skin is a standout amongst the most broad and promptly open organs on human body for topical organization and is primary course of topical medication conveyance framework. Gels have better potential as a vehicle to controlled medication topically in contrast with balm, since they are non-sticky requires low vitality amid the plan. Topical gels are proposed for skin application on the other hand to certain mucosal surfaces for neighborhood activity or percutaneous infiltration of medicament or for their emollient or defensive activity. Gels are assessed by taking after parameters, for example, pH, drug content, thickness (Brookfield viscometer), spreadability, and extrudability, skin disturbance on templates, in-vitro discharge, in steadiness.

Patient care can be improved by reducing the discomfort of local procedures and by minimizing the side effects of the anesthetics.\n\n==\n\nBoyce 1982:\n\nTitle: Beyond topicality : A two stage view of relevance and the retrieval process\n\nAbstract: Abstract Topicality is an operationally necessary but insufficient condition for requestor judged relevance. Documents are independent of one another as to any judgement of their topicality but not independent as to any judgement of their relevance which is a function of their informativeness to a requestor. Recall depends solely upon topicality but precision depends upon informativeness as well. A retrieval system which aspires to the retrieval of relevant documents should have a second stage which will order the topical set in a manner so as to provide maximum informativeness to the requestor. Should a system be concerned only with topicality then a two stage system which generates a high recall set and discards imprecise documents by measuring their distance from a seed document can be iterated to provide topicality feedback without user input.\n\n==\n\nHadgraft 2016:\n\nTitle: Advanced topical formulations (ATF).\n\nAbstract: Topical formulations aim to target the skin for a variety of cosmetic, protective or therapeutic needs. Despite the use of creams and ointments over the millennia, the bioavailability of actives from topical preparations remains quite low, often not exceeding 1-2% of the applied dose. In this review we examine the reasons underlying the poor performance of topical preparations. We also outline a rational approach, based on Fick's laws of diffusion, to develop advanced topical formulations. Methodologies which are currently used in research and development are critically examined and the importance of understanding the fate of the vehicle as well as the active is emphasised. Advanced topical formulation development will also be facilitated by emerging and sophisticated analytical techniques that are able to probe real time delivery of actives to the skin. A good understanding of the underlying physical chemistry of both the formulation and the skin is crucial in the development of optimised topical products.", "final_summary": "The research question \"topical beneficial\" is broad, but the collected papers provide insights into various aspects of topical applications, from medical to computational fields.\n\nIn the medical field, topical applications have been found to be beneficial in several ways.

Individual Job performance is the behavioural outcome of an employee which points out that the employee is showing positive attitudes towards his or her organization. Job performance is differently defined and measured in different disciplines in different ways. The main purpose of this paper is to define and to review theoretically and empirically the concept of job performance, measurement dimensions of job performance and empirical findings for measurement dimensions of job performance with reference to the various professions in service oriented organizations. As a desk research, this study reviewed literature regarding job performance and its dynamic nature, compared and analyzed dimensions (taxonomies) related to job performance, created a new definition and explained the importance of job performance adding novelty to the existing literature and provided suggestions for further studies.\n\n==\n\nMing-sum 1998:\n\nTitle: A Job Performance Model for Professional Social Workers\n\nAbstract: This paper defines job performance as a social construct from different perspectives, such as standards, behaviour, and process. A comprehensive model was constructed to explain the multiple realities of the job performance of professional social workers. The different perspectives of job performance: organizational performance, staff performance and quality of service were discussed. The dynamic relationships between various factors behind these components were also identified. Supervision and professional development for social workers, goals setting and strategy formulation for human service organizations, and programme evaluation for service delivery were proposed as guidelines for improving job performance of professional social workers.\n\n==\n\nSonnentag 2010:\n\nTitle: Job Performance\n\nAbstract: Individual performance is of high relevance for organizations and individuals alike. Showing high performance when accomplishing tasks results in satisfaction, feelings of selfefficacy and mastery (Bandura, 1997; Kanfer et aL, 2005). Moreover, high performing individuals get promoted, awarded and honored. Career opportunities for individuals who perform well are much better than those of moderate or low performing individuals (Van Scotter et aI., 2000). This chapter summarizes research on individual performance and addresses performance as a multi-dimensional and dynamic concept. First, we define the concept of performance, next we discuss antecedents of between-individual variation of performance, and describe intraindividual change and variability in performance, and finally, we present a research agenda for future research.\n\n==\n\nViswesvaran 2008:\n\nTitle: Job Performance: Assessment Issues in Personnel Selection\n\nAbstract: An important construct in Industrial, Work and Organizational (TWO) psychology, organizational behavior, and human resources management (personnel selection, training, and performance evaluation) in general, and personnel selection in particular, is the construct of job performance. Job performance is the most important dependent variable in TWO psychology (Schmidt & Hunter, 1992). A general definition of the construct of job performance reflects behaviors (both visually observable and non-observable) that can be evaluated (Viswesvaran, Ones, & Schmidt, 1996). In other words, job performance refers to scalable actions, behaviors, and outcomes that employees engage in or bring about that are linked with and contribute to organizational goals (Viswesvaran & Ones, 2000). To date, most researchers focusing on the construct of job performance have confined themselves to particular situations and settings with no attempt to generalize their findings. Also, there has been an emphasis on prediction and practical application rather than explanation and theory building. The consequence of these two trends has been a proliferation of the various measures of job performance in the extant literature. Virtually every measurable individual differences dimension thought to be relevant to the productivity, efficiency, or profitability of the unit or organization has been used as a measure of job performance. Absenteeism, productivity ratings, violence on the job, and teamwork ratings are some examples of the variety of measures used to measure job performance. There are multiple uses for job performance data. In selection contexts, measures of job performance are used to validate predictors. \u2018Thus, the choice of the job performance measure has important substantive implications for our practice and science of personnel selection. Measures of individual job performance play a central role at each step of the personnel selection function. Consider the first step in selection: recruitment of qualified applicants. One question in recruitment is whether the different sources of recruitment result in attraction of individuals who differ in job performance levels (Barber, 1998). Following successful recruitment efforts, attempts are made to identify individual differences variables that are related to individual differences in job performance, and select individuals based on those characteristics (Guion, 1998). Individual differences in job performance are assessed and those assessments are used in placement and promotion decisions.\n\n==\n\nJohnson 2009:\n\nTitle: A multi-level investigation of overall job performance ratings\n\nAbstract: Multi-level modeling was used to understand how supervisor assign overall job performance ratings. Results indicated a uniform relationship between task and overall performance ratings across supervisors but significant variability in the relationship between contextual and overall performance ratings. Employee and supervisor attributes were examined to explain this variability. Job performance is typically conceptualized as \" actions and behaviors that are under the control of the individual that contribute to the goals of the organization, \" (Rotundo & Sackett, 2002, p. 66). Campbell (1990) asserts that job performance is inherently multidimensional, a view that is shared by the vast majority of performance researchers (e. However, it is also generally accepted that, while multidimensional conceptions of performance are appropriate when conducting research, for decision making in organizations, a unidimensional, or composite criteria is preferred (e.g., Schmidt & Kaplan, 1971). And while the notion that raters will differ in the way they combine information to arrive at an overall rating is far from new (e.g., Naylor & Wherry, 1965), in the job performance domain, research dedicated to explaining this variability is limited. Performance Task performance refers to behaviors and activities that support the organization's technical core, which can involve the execution of technical processes (transforming raw materials into the goods or services provided by the organization) or the maintenance of those processes, for instance by providing raw materials, distributing products, or through planning and coordination functions (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993; Motowidlo, et al., 1997). The term contextual performance was coined by Borman and Motowidlo (1993) who argued that performance measures used in selection research and practice ignored activities such as persisting, helping, and endorsing organizational objectives. They argue that the criterion domain consists of task performance as well as contextual performance, or behaviors that support the broader psychological and social environment in which that technical core must function. An individual's overall performance rating can be thought of as a measure of his or her organizational worth (Motowidlo & Van Scotter, 1994). Implicit in this definition is that job performance must include only those behaviors that contribute to the organization's goals (Campbell, 1990). Accordingly, the rating assigned to an incumbent's overall job performance will depend not only on the level at which he or she performs certain behaviors, but also on the rater's beliefs about the goals of the organization and his or her mental model relating job behaviors to those goals.

It includes a definition of job performance that emphasizes the behavioral, episodic, and aggregate nature of the construct. The chapter reviews and discusses several well-established multidimensional models of job performance, along with emerging theories of performance such as adaptive performance and trait activation. Causal antecedents of job performance are discussed, including personality traits, cognitive ability, motivation, knowledge, and skill, along with their interrelations. Various dilemmas in theories of performance are explored, including whether organizational citizenship behavior is likely a latent or aggregate construct, whether counterproductive work behavior and organizational citizenship should be considered opposite ends of a single continuum or separate constructs, and how counterproductive work behavior could be a product of knowledge and skill. \n \n \nKeywords: \n \njob performance; \ncontextual performance; \norganizational citizenship behavior; \ncounterproductive work behavior; \nimplicit trait policies\n\n==\n\nCarlos 2016:\n\nTitle: Development and Validation of a Self-Reported Measure of Job Performance\n\nAbstract: The current turbulent context in which we live in requires, more and more, that organisations focus on improving the workers\u2019 performance. Individual performance is more than just the execution of specific tasks and it involves an ample variety of organisational activities that have important implications for the understanding and measurement of job performance. Considering the fact that most individual performance measures are developed in order to be applied in particular job-related contexts or cultures, our goal is to develop a job performance measure that might be applicable across jobs and cultures. After an extensive literature review, and based on studies that were developed in different cultural and job-related contexts, two dimensions\u2014task and contextual\u2014and eight sub dimensions of job performance were found: job knowledge, organisational skills, efficiency, persistent effort, cooperation, organisational consciousness, personal characteristics and interpersonal and relational skills. Confirmatory factorial analysis was used in order to test their relevance. The dimensions \u2018personal characteristics\u2019 and \u2018persistent effort\u2019 were merged. The resulting 29 item scale presents appropriate psychometric properties.\n\n==\n\nAketch 2012:\n\nTitle: Effects of quality of work life on job performance: theoretical perspectives and literature review\n\nAbstract: The concept of quality of work life exhibits positive emotional reactions and attitudes an individual has towards their job. It has been conceptualized as a general attitude toward the job. Job performance is often viewed as the degree to which employees execute their job tasks, responsibilities and assignments adequately. Motivation is the willingness to work at a certain level of effort and drives employees to action. Motivation emerges out of needs, values, goals, intentions and expectations. The study utilizes desk research to review literature on quality of work life that informs organization performance and motivation. The importance of considering these factors is demonstrated in the strong relationship between employee\u2019s well-being at work and performance of such organizations.", "final_summary": "Job performance is a multifaceted construct that is defined and measured in various ways across different disciplines. Ramawickrama (2017) defines it as the behavioral outcome of an employee that reflects positive attitudes towards their organization. Ming-sum (1998) takes a broader perspective, defining job performance as a social construct that encompasses standards, behavior, and process. This definition is echoed by Viswesvaran (2008), who describes job performance as scalable actions, behaviors, and outcomes that employees engage in or bring about that are linked with and contribute to organizational goals.\n\nThe dimensions of job performance are also diverse. Sonnentag (2010) and Johnson (2009) both emphasize the multidimensional nature of job performance, with Johnson (2009) suggesting that it includes both task and contextual performance. Carlos (2016) expands on this by identifying eight sub-dimensions of job performance, including job knowledge, organizational skills, efficiency, persistent effort, cooperation, organizational consciousness, personal characteristics, and interpersonal and relational skills.\n\nMotowidlo (2012) introduces the concept of adaptive performance and trait activation as emerging theories in job performance. He also discusses the causal antecedents of job performance, including personality traits, cognitive ability, motivation, knowledge, and skill. Aketch (2012) adds to this by suggesting that the quality of work life, which exhibits positive emotional reactions and attitudes an individual has towards their job, can also affect job performance.\n\nIn conclusion, job performance is a complex construct that encompasses a wide range of behaviors, outcomes, and dimensions. It is influenced by various factors, including individual traits, skills, motivation, and the quality of work life.

Normally, this occurs as an unpromoted process, but in Chile, it is driven by the legal framework. This research focuses on rural residential plots (RRPs) around the capital city, Santiago. The analysis seeks to understand the significance and consequences of RRPs during the last four decades and the role of a favorable legal framework in affecting their development. By examining data and official cartography on rural residential plots, the analysis shows a large phenomenon of rapid RRP development in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile (MR). The study confirms the existence of an ongoing process that is still partially latent and potentially both uncontrolled and evolving. This work demonstrates the negative effect that land liberalization policies can have by promoting territorial transformations that policymakers cannot subsequently control. The conclusions provide a critical perspective on the counter-urbanization process in the context of fragility and scarce resources.\n\n==\n\nContesse 2018:\n\nTitle: Is urban agriculture urban green space? A comparison of policy arrangements for urban green space and urban agriculture in Santiago de Chile\n\nAbstract: Urban green spaces are crucial for citizens\u2019 wellbeing. Nonetheless, many Latin American cities struggle to provide sufficient and equitable green space distribution for their citizens. By looking at the Chilean capital Santiago as an example, this paper examines whether the growing urban agriculture movement provides a feasible opportunity to increase public urban green space access. It does so by using the policy arrangement approach to analyse change and stability in two policy domains: urban green space planning and urban agriculture. The paper investigates urban green spaces and urban agriculture and the role of practitioners, urban planners and policymakers. The analysis found opportunities for urban agriculture to facilitate the expansion of urban green spaces in Santiago if policy mechanisms enable private or public spaces to be maintained by citizen organizations. Such mechanisms may, however, encounter resistance from public agencies, as it is unresolved who is involved and who benefits from urban agriculture. The paper concludes that urban agriculture is an opportunity for urban greening in Santiago, although changes are needed in how green areas are planned and conceived. Additionally, urban agriculture should not be understood as a substitute for parks but as a complementary form of green space provision with a distinctive value.\n\n==\n\nPauchard 2006:\n\nTitle: Multiple effects of urbanization on the biodiversity of developing countries: the case of a fast-growing metropolitan area (Concepci\u00f3n, Chile).\n\nAbstract: Urbanization is increasingly homogenizing the biota of less developed countries. Even though urban sprawl is a worldwide problem, most studies on the effects of urbanization, and the conceptual models have focused on developed countries. South America has not escaped urbanization, and here we discuss the potential impacts of urban sprawl with respect to three ecosystems in the metropolitan area of Concepcion, Chile. We consider this area a good model and fairly representative of other cities in developing countries which are also experiencing rapid and uncontrolled growth. We found that the impacts of urban sprawl on biodiversity in the metropolitan area of Concepcion differ little from cities in other parts of the world: native ecosystems are replaced by pavements and buildings and what is left of the natural soil is covered with green areas dominated by non-native ornamental species. Wetlands and other peri-urban ecosystems are rapidly being destroyed, fragmented or invaded by non-native species. We found that from a study area of 32,000 ha, there was a net loss to urbanization of 1734 ha of wetlands (23% of the original) and 1417 ha (9%) of agricultural, forest and shrub land cover types between 1975 and 2000. From the total area urbanized (3151 ha), 55% corresponded to wetlands and 45% to agricultural, forest and shrub lands cover types. We see the lack of environmental awareness as a major cause of the increasing deterioration of biodiversity in urban areas of developing countries. More research is needed to fully understand the effects of urban sprawl on the biodiversity of developing countries to include these ecosystems in global conservation strategies.\n\n==\n\nGeisse 1978:\n\nTitle: Urbanizaci\u00f3n e industrializaci\u00f3n en Chile.\n\nAbstract: INTRODUCCION En este trabajo se sintetizaran los principales aspectos desarrollados con mayor detalle en un proyecto de investigacion mas extenso sobre las interrelaciones entre desarrollo economico y la urbanizacion en el caso chileno durante el presente siglo hasta fines de la decada de los anos sesenta .

This information is important to understand the geographical distribution of gains associated with the transformation of the rural sector during a period of rapid development, trade liberalization and transition toward a predominant emphasis on export earnings in agriculture. A large set of data of rural land transactions for 1980, 1990, 1997 and 2007 were collected from a sample of land registry offices. Results show notable declines in the physical size of transactions, significant average annual rates of increase in real per-hectare values, and a small-parcel premium for rural land associated with non-farm land use. Overall real land values have increased faster than the average annual growth rates in the agricultural sector\u2019s value added, suggesting that land owners have gained proportionately more than other claimants to sectoral income. Tests show significant geographic disparities in annual rates of land appreciation across regions and municipalities. Consistent with differential net gains due to integration into world markets and the geographic heterogeneity of suitability for different land uses, northern areas, with greater emphasis on export-oriented crops, have experienced the highest average rates of annual real per-hectare value growth, in the order of 7 percent, while southern areas, emphasizing traditional crops and pastures/livestock, have experienced growth rates of half that. Geographic disparities are also explained by proximity to urban population and income centers.\n\n==\n\nMarques 2012:\n\nTitle: Urban Agriculture in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago de Chile An Environmental Instrument to Create a Sustainable Urban Model\n\nAbstract: Currently, the city of Santiago de Chile represents an example of the rapid and expansive development experienced by capitals of developing countries.

In the fields of epidemiology and public health, the distinction between primary and secondary data depends on the relationship between the person or research team who collected a data set and the person who is analyzing it. This is an important concept because the same data set could be primary data in one analysis and secondary data in another. If the data set in question was collected by the researcher (or a team of which the researcher is a part) for the specific purpose or analysis under consideration, it is primary data . If it was collected by someone else for some other purpose, it is secondary data . Of course, there will always be cases in which this distinction is less clear, but it may be useful to conceptualize primary and secondary data by considering two extreme cases. In the first, which is an example of primary data , a research team conceives of and develops a research project, collects data designed to address specific questions posed by the project, and performs and publishes their own analyses of the data they have collected. In this case, the people involved in analyzing the data have some involvement in, or at least familiarity with, the research design and data collection process, and the data were collected to answer the questions examined in the analysis.\n\n==\n\nSilman 2018:\n\nTitle: Use of secondary data\n\nAbstract: Primary data collection is challenging and with increasing electronic data capture in routine healthcare and other aspects of life, it is possible to address several epidemiological questions by robust analysis of such \u2018secondary data\u2019. There are considerable advantages in terms of scope, size, and speed of study to be balanced against the quality and depth of using primary data. Even when such direct contact is not required, there is often the need to extract necessary information from individual subject records such as medical files. There is often no alternative source of information, although the greater digitization of information is changing that scenario with the potential that the availability of such information might preclude the need for primary data.\n\n==\n\nGlass 1976:\n\nTitle: Primary, Secondary, and Meta-Analysis of Research1\n\nAbstract: M y subject is data analysis at three levels. Primary analysis is the original analysis of data in a research study. It is what one typically imagines as the application of statistical methods. Secondary analysis is the re-analysis of data for the purpose of answering the original research question with better statistical techniques, or answering new questions with old data. Secondary analysis is an important feature of the research and evaluation enterprise. Tom Cook (1974) at Northwestern University has written about its purposes and methods. Some of our best methodologists have pursued secondary analyses in such grand style that its importance has eclipsed that of the primary analysis. We can cite with pride some state of the art documents: the MostellerMoynihan secondary analysis of the Coleman study; the Campbell-Erlebacher analysis of the Ohio-Westinghouse Headstart evaluation; and the Elashoff-Snow secondary analysis of Pygmalion in the Classroom, to name three. About all that can effectively be done to insure that secondary analyses of important studies are carried out is to see that the data from the original studies are preserved and that secondary analyses are funded. The preservation of original data could improve. Last month, one of our graduate students, Karl White, spent 15 hours and made 30 phone calls attempting to obtain from the government a copy of the data tapes for the Coleman study only to learn in the end that they had been irretrievably filed in unmarked tape cannisters with some 2,000 other unmarked data tapes. Tom Cook remarked in an Annual Meeting symposium on secondary analysis that you can get the data if you have chutzpah or if you're socio metrically well-connected. The whole business is too important to be treated so casually. On the other extreme, one can point with satisfaction to the ready availability to any researcher of the data tapes from Project TALENT or the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Others are advancing the practice of secondary analysis. My major interest currently is in what we have come to call\u2014not for want of a less pretentious name\u2014the meta-analysis of research. The term is a bit grand, but it is precise, and apt, and in the spirit of \"metamathematics,\" \"meta-psychology,\" and \"meta-evaluation.\" Meta-analysis refers to the analysis of analyses. I use it to refer to the statistical analysis of a large collection of analysis results from individual studies for the purpose of integrating the findings. It connotes a rigorous alternative to the casual, narrative discussions of research studies which typify our attempts to make sense of the rapidly expanding research literature. The need for the meta-analysis of research is clear. The literature on dozens of topics in education is growing at an astounding rate. In five years time, researchers can produce literally hundreds of studies on IQ and creativity, or impulsive vs. reflective cognitive styles, or any other topic.\n\n==\n\nSchindler 2005:\n\nTitle: Webservices Infrastructure for the Registration of Scientific Primary Data\n\nAbstract: Registration of scientific primary data, to make these data citable as a unique piece of work and not only a part of a publication, has always been an important issue.

PEComas arising in visceral organs outside of the kidney, liver, and lung are rare, and often pose problems in diagnosis. Examples of this neoplasm originating in the adrenal gland are limited. The present report details the clinical and pathologic features of an unusual case of a pure epithelioid PEComa (epithelioid angiomyolipoma) of the adrenal gland exhibiting clinically malignant behavior in the form of pulmonary metastases, a feature not previously described in tumors of this site. The diagnosis was supported by immunohistochemical studies demonstrating expression of myoid and melanocytic antigens. The present case serves to emphasize the potential of PEComa for clinically aggressive behavior and the importance of distinguishing this tumor from other epithelioid neoplasms that are more commonly encountered in the adrenal gland.\n\n==\n\nBattistella 2023:\n\nTitle: Metastatic Adrenal PEComa: Case Report and Short Review of the Literature\n\nAbstract: PEComa has become a widely accepted entity, and increased recognition has led to descriptions of this tumor in a wide variety of anatomic sites, including the adrenal gland. PEComa (perivascular epithelioid cell tumor) is a mesenchymal tumor composed of perivascular cells, and the most frequent sites of PEComas are the uterus and retroperitoneum. The incidence is <1 per 1,000,000 people. We report a case of adrenal metastatic PEComa in a 63-year-old man discovered by a spontaneous hematoma of the rectus abdominis. In our case, PEComa of the adrenal gland was a significant diagnostic dilemma as the morphologic and immunophenotypic features of this neoplasm may easily be confused with those of other more commonly encountered lesions.\n\n==\n\nPant 2015:\n\nTitle: Malignant Perivascular Epithelioid Cell Tumor (PEComa) of the Adrenal Gland: Report of a Rare Case Posing Diagnostic Challenge with the Role of Immunohistochemistry in the Diagnosis\n\nAbstract: Histological diagnosis of adrenal tumors is often challenging as diverse groups of tumors, both primaries and metastatic, may be seen in the adrenal gland with overlapping morphological features. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) plays the most important role in their diagnosis. Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa), a rarely reported tumor in the adrenal gland, shares many features with another rare tumor sarcomatoid adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). Extensive immunohistochemical study is required to distinguish this tumor from adrenocortical carcinoma and from other morphologically similar tumors. The unique combination of immunoreactivity for melanocytic markers, such as HMB-45 and Melan A, and myogenic markers, such as smooth muscle actin, is the hallmark of PEComas biological behavior, and prognosis of malignant PEComas is yet to be fully understood. Few cases of malignant PEComa have been reported in the adrenal gland. We report a case of malignant PEComa of the adrenal gland posing diagnostic challenge and compare its morphological and immunohistochemical features with those of sarcomatoid ACC.\n\n==\n\nIi 2016:\n\nTitle: Angiomyolipoma and Malignant PEComa: Discussion of Two Rare Adrenal Tumors\n\nAbstract: Angiomyolipoma and PEComa are rare tumors descending from perivascular epithelial cells (PECs), with distinctive IHC, morphological, and ultrastructural features. The kidney is the most frequent site of origin, but not the only one; however, adrenal gland angiomyolipomas are extremely rare. We describe two cases being found in the adrenal glands. Given the paucity of literature on the subject, more information on this disease is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Here, we describe two complete case reports, from presentation to treatment and follow-up, along with imaging and microscopic pathology samples, and provide a comprehensive review as to the history and current literature available regarding these extremely rare tumors.\n\n==\n\nKumar 2010:\n\nTitle: Perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa) of the inferior vena cava presenting as an adrenal mass\n\nAbstract: Abstract A 54-year-old woman had a mass located in the right suprarenal area. On imaging, this mass appeared to be infiltrating the inferior vena cava (IVC). Exploratory laparotomy was undertaken and excision of the tumour was done with the sleeve of the involved IVC. The mass turned out to be a perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa) on histopathological examination.

This group of lesions includes angiomyolipoma, clear cell \"sugar\" tumor of the lung and extrapulmonary sites, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, clear cell myomelanocytic tumor of the falciform ligament/ligamentum teres, and rare clear cell tumors of other anatomical sites. In the genitourinary tract, PEComas have been described in the kidney, bladder, prostate, testis, and urethra. Although most PEComas behave as benign tumors, some are potentially malignant, and criteria for malignancy have been suggested for both and renal and extrarenal lesions. Recently, the expression of cathepsin K has been demonstrated in a large number of PEComas and has been proposed as a relatively specific marker to distinguish these proliferations from the majority of human cancers. In addition, a distinctive subset of PEComas harboring TFE3 gene fusions has been reported, giving rise to a possible relationship between them and MiTF/TFE family translocation renal cell carcinomas. The genetic alterations of tuberous sclerosis complex that promote activation of the mTOR pathway have been identified in PEComas. Therapy with mTORC1 inhibitors has been shown to be effective in some cases.\n\n==\n\nMcligeyo 1996:\n\nTitle: Renal vein and intracaval invasion by an adrenal phaeochromocytoma with extension Into the right atrium: a case study.\n\nAbstract: A 30 year old female with an unexpected right adrenal phaechromacytoma invading the renal vein, the inferior vena cava and extending into the right atrium is presented. She also had BuddChiari syndrome due to invasion of the hepatic veins by the tumour. Additionally, the tumour had metastasised to the liver and the lungs. Despite elevated 24 hour urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) the patient was normotensive pre-operatively.

Unfortunately, the patient developed multiple hypotensive episodes and adult respiratory distress syndrome post-operatively and died three weeks after surgery.\n\n==\n\nZhao 2014:\n\nTitle: Sclerosing PEComa of the kidney: clinicopathologic analysis of 2 cases and review of the literature.\n\nAbstract: Introduction Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are a group of uncommon neoplasms that include angiomyolipoma, clear cell \u201csugar\u201d tumor of the lung, lymphangiomyomatosis, and a variety of unusual visceral, intra-abdominal, and soft tissue/bone tumors (such as clear cell myomelanocytic tumor of the falciform ligament/ ligamentum teres, abdominopelvic sarcoma of perivascular epithelioid cells, and primary extrapulmonary sugar tumor). The prototypic cell called perivascular epithelioid cell (PEC) has unique morphologic, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and genetic features that are characterized by perivascular location, often with a radial arrangement of cells around the vascular lumen. PECs typically show immunoreactivity for both melanocytic markers (such as HMB-45 [human melanoma black], melan-A [MLANA], and microphthalmia transcription factor [MiTF]) and muscle markers (such as smooth muscle actin [SMA] and calponin). Hornick and Fletcher have described a distinctive variant of PEComa having a hyalinized stroma and a striking predilection for the retroperitoneum of middle-aged women, for which they proposed the term sclerosing PEComa.

That is why they take their meanings and their sense from this society. They are particularly linked with corporate governance which is also linked with the contemporary developments of capitalism seen as a political order. That is why performance measurement and evaluations sytems in today\u2019s companies are the production of a social game which has to be understood. Key indicators like shareholder\u2019s value and actors like auditing firms play a specific role which has to be evaluated. This paper will introduce the discussion about these systems (and moreover management tools) as the production of their society from a posture taken from Political Philosophy. They will be evaluated in relation which what is capitalism today (which has to be understood in relation with what it was yesterday). That is why notions like shareholder\u2019s value will be linked with the increasing weight of investments funds and with the systematic search for financial surplus. It will be induced that all these \u201cconcrete\u201d notions build a system and are reciprocally re\u2010enforced. A special mention will be made to auditing firms as a cartel.

Agency theory and stewardship theory serve as the bases of a conceptual model. Five corporate governance mechanisms are examined on two financial performance indicators, return on assets (ROA) and Tobin's Q, employing cross-sectional regression methodology. The conclusion drawn from empirical test so performed on 252 firms listed on London Stock Exchange for the year 2014 indicates a positive or a negative relationship, but also sometimes no effect, of corporate governance mechanisms impact on financial performance. The implications are discussed. Thereby, so distinguishing effects due to causes, we present a proof that, when the right corporate governance mechanisms are chosen, the finances of a firm can be improved.

The key one was the Cadbury Committee, which recommended a number of governance structures as examples of best practice. These included the separation of the posts of CEO and chairman, a significant representation of non\u2010executive directors, the importance of non\u2010executive director independence and the setting up of board subcommittees. This study finds that there has been widespread adoption of the recommended governance structures. However, there is no clear relationship between governance structures and corporate performance.

One key question may relate to the purpose of corporate governance \u2013 is it about the control of risks, the improvement of performance, or both? If this could be clarified, criteria could be developed to measure the success of corporate governance procedures or codes. This research investigates whether companies with particular corporate governance characteristics outperform other companies and have lower levels of risk. The governance characteristics investigated in the report are: board independence; board size; directors\u2019 ownership of equity; and extent of ownership by large block holders. The effects of these characteristics were measured over two three year periods between 1999 and 2004. Three measures of performance were used: one stock market measure (market to book ratio); and two accounting based measures (return on assets and ratio of sales to total assets). Risk was measured in three ways: total risk; systematic risk; and a measure of sudden share price falls. The findings reveal no clear systematic relationship between governance factors and improved performance, and no strong evidence that governance reduces either total or systematic risk.

We also investigate how firms use the flexibility offered by the voluntary governance regime to make governance choices. We find a strong positive association between the board governance index we construct and firm operating performance. Our results imply that adherence to the board-related recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code strengthens the board's monitoring capacity, potentially helping mitigate agency problems, but that investors do not value it correspondingly. Moreover, in contrast to prior UK findings suggesting efficient adoption of Code recommendations, we find that firms at times use the Code flexibility opportunistically, aiming to decrease the monitoring capacity of the board, which is followed by subsequent underperformance. This finding questions the effectiveness of the voluntary approach to governance regulation followed in the UK as in many countries around the world. \n \nThis article is protected by copyright.

In an eight arms baited paradigm, choice accuracy was enhanced following 12 days but not 3 days of treatment. In addition, performance during acquisition of the eight arms baited maze task was better in estrogen-treated Ovx rats than in Ovx rats. Performance of treated rats was also enhanced in win-shift trials conducted 12 days postestrogen treatment. Working, reference, and working-reference memory was examined when four of the eight arms were baited, and only working memory was improved by estrogen and only after long-term treatment. Activity of Ovx rats on an open field, crossings and rearings, was increased at 5 but not at 35 days following estrogen treatment. In medial prefrontal cortex, levels of NE, DA, and 5-HT were decreased but glutamate and GABA levels were not affected following chronic estrogen treatment. Basal forebrain nuclei also showed changes in monoamines following estrogen. Hippocampal subfields showed no effects of estrogen treatment on monoaminergic or amino acid transmitters. Levels of GABA were increased in the vertical diagonal bands following chronic estrogen. Results show that estrogen enhances learning/memory on a task utilizing spatial memory. Effects in Ovx rats appear to require the chronic (several days) presence of estrogen. Changes in activity of both monoaminergic and amino acid transmitters in the frontal cortex and basal forebrain may contribute to enhancing effects of estrogen on learning/memory.\n\n==\n\nHarburger 2007:\n\nTitle: Effects of estrogen and progesterone on spatial memory consolidation in aged females\n\nAbstract: Interpretation of data illustrating that estrogen, with or without progestin, is detrimental to memory in post-menopausal women is complicated by the fact that little is known about the effects of progestins on memory. The present study examined if estrogen, alone or with progesterone, affects spatial memory consolidation in ovariectomized aged female mice. Mice received eight training trials in a spatial Morris water maze followed immediately by injection of water-soluble 17beta-estradiol (E(2); 0.2 mg/kg) or vehicle. Mice were re-tested 24 h later. All mice learned to find the platform on Day 1. On Day 2, the performance of control, but not E(2) mice, deteriorated, suggesting that E(2) enhanced memory for the platform location. In a second experiment, mice were injected with E(2) and 10 or 20 mg/kg water-soluble progesterone. The 10 mg/kg dose of progesterone did not affect estrogen's ability to enhance spatial memory consolidation, but 20 mg/kg blocked this effect. These data indicate that estrogen can improve spatial memory consolidation in aged females and that this effect can be attenuated by progesterone.\n\n==\n\nRissman 2002:\n\nTitle: Disruption of estrogen receptor \u03b2 gene impairs spatial learning in female mice\n\nAbstract: Here we provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that estradiol (E2) affects learning and memory via the newly discovered estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER\u03b2). In this study, ER\u03b2 knockout (ER\u03b2KO) and wild-type littermates were tested for spatial learning in the Morris water maze after ovariectomy, appropriate control treatment, or one of two physiological doses of E2. Regardless of treatment, all wild-type females displayed significant learning. However, ER\u03b2KOs given the low dose of E2 were delayed in learning acquisition, and ER\u03b2KOs administered the higher dose of E2 failed to learn the task. These data show that ER\u03b2 is required for optimal spatial learning and may have implications for hormone replacement therapy in women.\n\n==\n\nVarga 2002:\n\nTitle: Weak if any effect of estrogen on spatial memory in rats\n\nAbstract: In a number of species, males appear to have spatial abilities that are superior to those of females. The favored explanation for this cognitive difference is hormonal: higher testosterone levels in males than in females. An alternative explanation focuses on the role of varying levels of estrogens in females during the estrus cycle; females perform as well as males on days of low estrogen, but more poorly on days of high estrogen. Other investigators have reported that estrogens improve both types of memory processes, which depend on the striatal (nonspatial navigation) and hippocampal (spatial) memory systems. Additionally, estrogens have been found to protect the working memory. These contradictory results initiated the present study, in which ovariectomized female rats were trained to escape in a Morris water maze. The daily trials were preceded by estradiol application in low doses (Experiment I) or in higher doses (Experiment II). In Experiment I, no differences at all were found between the latencies of the treated and control groups to reach a submerged platform in a Morris water maze. In Experiment II, however, the animals treated with the higher dose of estradiol showed a small deficit in the acquisition of the Morris water maze task. This study indicates that estradiol at around the physiological level has no effect on spatial learning and memory functions. + Dedicated to Professor Otto Feher on the occasion of his 75 th birthday.\n\n==\n\nSilverman 1993:\n\nTitle: Effects of estrogen changes during the menstrual cycle on spatial performance\n\nAbstract: Abstract Four sequential, interrelated studies of the relationship of menstrual cycle phase to three-dimensional mental rotations performance were conducted, using both between-and within-subjects designs. All studies showed significant increases in mean mental rotations scores during the menstrual period phase, when estrogen levels were at their lowest. Effects occurred only for mental rotations; relationships with hormonal status did not occur for control tests, which were not of a spatial nature, and a different spatial test (Space Relations). Findings are discussed as they relate to ontogenetic development and evolutionary origins of sex-specific differences in spatial behaviors.\n\n==\n\nGibbs 1999:\n\nTitle: Estrogen Replacement Enhances Acquisition of a Spatial Memory Task and Reduces Deficits Associated with Hippocampal Muscarinic Receptor Inhibition\n\nAbstract: A delayed matching-to-position (DMP) T-maze task was used to examine the effects of estrogen replacement on spatial learning and memory, as well as the ability of estrogen replacement to reduce performance deficits produced by acute systemic and intrahippocampal muscarinic cholinergic inhibition. Two experiments were performed. In Experiment 1, ovariectomized animals were trained to criterion on the DMP task and then tested with increased intertrial delays and following systemic scopolamine administration. The animals then received either continuous estrogen replacement or sham surgery and were retested beginning 10 days later. In Experiment 2, ovariectomized animals received guide cannulae implanted bilaterally into the hippocampus. Half of these animals also began receiving continuous estrogen replacement. Two months later, the animals were trained on the DMP task and then tested with increased intertrial delays and following systemic as well as intrahippocampal scopolamine administration. Animals received the same test battery 8 months later and were then immediately trained on a reversal task. The results indicate that estrogen-treated animals acquired the DMP task at a significantly faster rate than the ovariectomized, non-estrogen-treated controls. In addition, estrogen replacement significantly reduced deficits in DMP performance produced by intrahippocampal, but not systemic, scopolamine administration. This occurred when animals were tested after 3.5 months, as well as after 12 months, of continuous estrogen replacement. No evidence for an effect of estrogen replacement on spatial working memory or reversal learning was detected. These findings demonstrate that estrogen replacement can enhance acquisition of a spatial memory task and reduce performance deficits associated with hippocampal cholinergic impairment.\n\n==\n\nFrick 2002:\n\nTitle: Estrogen replacement improves spatial reference memory and increases hippocampal synaptophysin in aged female mice\n\nAbstract: Estrogen deficiency during menopause is often associated with memory dysfunction. However, inconsistencies regarding the ability of estrogen to improve memory in menopausal women highlight the need to evaluate, in a controlled animal model, the potential for estrogen to alleviate age-related mnemonic decline. The current study tested whether estrogen could ameliorate spatial reference memory decline in aged female mice. At the conclusion of testing, levels of the presynaptic protein synaptophysin, and activities of the synthetic enzymes for acetylcholine and GABA, were measured in the hippocampus and neocortex. Aged (27-28-month-old) female C57BL/6 mice were given daily subcutaneous injections of 1 microg or 5 microg of beta-estradiol-3-benzoate dissolved in sesame oil. Control mice received daily injections of sesame oil or no injections. Estradiol treatment began 5 days prior to behavioral testing and continued throughout testing. Spatial and non-spatial memory were assessed in the Morris water maze. The 5 microg dose of estradiol significantly improved spatial learning and memory in aged females. The performance of 5 microg females improved significantly more rapidly than that of control females; estradiol-treated females performed at asymptotic levels by session 2. Furthermore, 5 microg females exhibited a more robust spatial bias than controls during probe trials. In contrast, 1 microg of estradiol did not improve spatial task performance. Neither dose affected performance of the non-spatial task. In the hippocampus, synaptophysin was increased in 5 microg females relative to controls. Estrogen did not affect enzyme activities in either brain region. This study is the first to examine the effects of estrogen replacement on spatial reference memory and synaptophysin expression in aged post-estropausal female rodents. The results suggest that: (1) estrogen can profoundly improve spatial reference memory in aged females, and (2) this improvement may be related to increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity, but not modulation of the synthetic enzymes for acetylcholine and GABA.\n\n==\n\nSandstrom 2004:\n\nTitle: Spatial memory retention is enhanced by acute and continuous estradiol replacement\n\nAbstract: Estradiol replacement to ovariectomized female rats causes dramatic changes in hippocampal structure and function as well as in performance on hippocampally dependent tasks. Using a delayed matching-to-place version of the water maze, the present study examines the time course of estradiol-induced enhancements in memory retention as well as the effectiveness of acute and continuous patterns of replacement. One 10-microg injection of estradiol administered on each of two successive days resulted in significant improvements in memory retention that persisted for approximately 4 days following the second injection. When estradiol administration continued for 10 consecutive days, these improvements in memory retention persisted. These findings indicate that estradiol replacement can improve memory retention and that these improvements can be maintained by continuous replacement for at least 10 days.", "final_summary": "The effects of estrogen on spatial memory have been extensively studied, with a variety of findings reported. \n\nLuine (1998) found that chronic estrogen treatment enhanced spatial memory in ovariectomized rats, suggesting a positive effect of estrogen on spatial memory.

These data regimes have come under increased scrutiny, as critics point out the myriad ways that they can reproduce or even amplify pre-existing biases in the criminal justice system. This essay examines contemporary debates regarding the use of \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d as a vehicle for criminal justice reform, by closely examining two general approaches to, what has been widely branded as, \u201calgorithmic fairness\u201d in criminal law: 1) the development of formal fairness criteria and accuracy measures that illustrate the trade-offs of different algorithmic interventions and 2) the development of \u201cbest practices\u201d and managerialist standards for maintaining a baseline of accuracy, transparency and validity in these systems. The essay argues that attempts to render AI-branded tools more accurate by addressing narrow notions of \u201cbias,\u201d miss the deeper methodological and epistemological issues regarding the fairness of these tools. The key question is whether predictive tools reflect and reinforce punitive practices that drive disparate outcomes, and how data regimes interact with the penal ideology to naturalize these practices. The article concludes by calling for an abolitionist understanding of the role and function of the carceral state, in order to fundamentally reformulate the questions we ask, the way we characterize existing data, and how we identify and fill gaps in existing data regimes of the carceral state.\n\n==\n\nHartmann 2021:\n\nTitle: Uncertainty, risk and the use of algorithms in policy decisions: a case study on criminal justice in the USA\n\nAbstract: Algorithms are increasingly used in different domains of public policy. They help humans to profile unemployed, support administrations to detect tax fraud and give recidivism risk scores that judges or criminal justice managers take into account when they make bail decisions. In recent years, critics have increasingly pointed to ethical challenges of these tools and emphasized problems of discrimination, opaqueness or accountability, and computer scientists have proposed technical solutions to these issues. In contrast to these important debates, the literature on how these tools are implemented in the actual everyday decision-making process has remained cursory. This is problematic because the consequences of ADM systems are at least as dependent on the implementation in an actual decision-making context as on their technical features. In this study, we show how the introduction of risk assessment tools in the criminal justice sector on the local level in the USA has deeply transformed the decision-making process. We argue that this is mainly due to the fact that the evidence generated by the algorithm introduces a notion of statistical prediction to a situation which was dominated by fundamental uncertainty about the outcome before. While this expectation is supported by the case study evidence, the possibility to shift blame to the algorithm does seem much less important to the criminal justice actors.\n\n==\n\nPutera 2022:\n\nTitle: Artificial Intelligence-Powered Criminal Sentencing in Malaysia: A conflict with the rule of law\n\nAbstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to heighten human decision-making, including in court. AI sentencing would be better at detecting, organizing, and calibrating all of the variables correlated to sentencing, such as prior criminal records, educational background, substance abuse history, and employment history, resulting in consistencies that traditional sentencing may not be able to provide. AI pervades the Malaysian judiciary system when AI criminal sentencing was launched for the first time to augment the process of meting out sentences in Sabah courts. Despite its promising benefits, AI sentencing may infringe the fundamental principle of due process, presents unacceptable risks of error and implicit bias, and reliance on AI to predict recidivism which forms significant components of the rule of law. The rule of law guarantees that all entities are subject to and accountable to a clear and known law. It enables the judicial branch of the government to be independent and to resolve dispute in a fair manner while upholding the presumption of innocence and preventing the exercise of arbitrary powers. The present research, therefore, examines the use of AI in supporting court processes and human judges, discovering its technical characteristics, practical constraints, and legal theoretical consequences for decision-making processes. Employing jurisprudential analysis as the method of research, this research explores an adjudicatory paradigm that prefers standardisation over discretion, leading in the waning of the notion of rule of law pertinent to the justice system. The metamorphosis to AI adjudication will undoubtedly promote the growth of digitalized dispute resolution by providing efficiency and at least a semblance of impartiality, but it is also poised to birth concerns by making the legal system data-driven, alienating, and disillusioning.\nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence in Courts, Artificial Intelligence in Criminal Justice\u00a0\neISSN: 2398-4287\u00a9 2022.

These models may, in turn, be embedded into a digital tool to inform, or even to automate, organisational decisions.

Such risk assessments have traditionally been the function of the human discretion and intuition of judicial officers, based on clinical assessments, framed by legislation and common-law principles, and encapsulating the concept of individualised justice. Yet, the progressive technologisation of criminal procedure is witnessing the incursion of statistical, data-driven evaluations of risk. Human judicial evaluative functions are increasingly complemented by a range of actuarial, algorithmic, machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that purport to provide accurate predictive capabilities and objective, consistent risk assessments. But ethical concerns have been raised globally regarding algorithms as proprietary products with in-built statistical bias as well as the diminution of judicial human evaluation in favour of the machine. This article focuses on risk assessment and what happens when decision-making is delegated to a predictive tool. Specifically, this article scrutinises the inscrutable proprietary nature of such risk tools and how that may render the calculation of the risk score opaque and unknowable to both the offender and the court.\n\n==\n\nChiao 2019:\n\nTitle: Fairness, accountability and transparency: notes on algorithmic decision-making in criminal justice\n\nAbstract: Abstract Over the last few years, legal scholars, policy-makers, activists and others have generated a vast and rapidly expanding literature concerning the ethical ramifications of using artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data and predictive software in criminal justice contexts. These concerns can be clustered under the headings of fairness, accountability and transparency. First, can we trust technology to be fair, especially given that the data on which the technology is based are biased in various ways? Second, whom can we blame if the technology goes wrong, as it inevitably will on occasion? Finally, does it matter if we do not know how an algorithm works or, relatedly, cannot understand how it reached its decision? I argue that, while these are serious concerns, they are not irresolvable. More importantly, the very same concerns of fairness, accountability and transparency apply, with even greater urgency, to existing modes of decision-making in criminal justice. The question, hence, is comparative: can algorithmic modes of decision-making improve upon the status quo in criminal justice? There is unlikely to be a categorical answer to this question, although there are some reasons for cautious optimism.\n\n==\n\nElyounes 2020:\n\nTitle: Bail or Jail? Judicial Versus Algorithmic Decision-Making in the Pretrial System\n\nAbstract: To date, there are approximately sixty risk assessment tools deployed in the criminal justice system. These tools aim to differentiate between low-, medium-, and high-risk defendants and to increase the likelihood that only those who pose a risk to public safety or who are likely to flee are detained. Proponents of actuarial tools claim that these tools are meant to eliminate human biases and to rationalize the decision-making process by summarizing all relevant information in a more efficient way than can the human brain. Opponents of such tools fear that in the name of science, actuarial tools reinforce human biases, harm defendants\u2019 rights, and increase racial disparities in the system. The gap between the two camps has widened in the last few years. Policymakers are torn between the promise of technology to contribute to a more just system and a growing movement that calls for the abolishment of the use of actuarial risk assessment tools in general and the use of machine learning-based tools in particular. \nThis paper examines the role that technology plays in this debate and examines whether deploying artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) in existing risk assessment tools realizes the fears emphasized by opponents of automation or improves our criminal justice system. It focuses on the pretrial stage and examines in depth the seven most commonly used tools. Five of these tools are based on traditional regression analysis, and two have a machine-learning component. This paper concludes that classifying pretrial risk assessment tools as AI-based tools creates the impression that sophisticated robots are taking over the courts and pushing judges from their jobs, but that impression is far from reality. Despite the hype, there are more similarities than differences between tools based on traditional regression analysis and tools based on machine learning. Robots have a long way to go before they can replace judges, and this paper does not argue for replacement. The long list of policy recommendations discussed in the last chapter highlights the extensive work that needs to be done to ensure that risk assessment tools are both accurate and fair toward all members of society. These recommendations apply regardless of whether machine learning or regression analysis is used. Special attention is paid to assessing how machine learning would impact those recommendations. For example, this paper argues that carefully detailing each of the factors used in the tools and including multiple options to choose from (i.e., not just binary \u201cyes-or-no\u201d questions) will be useful for both regression analysis and machine learning. However, machine learning would likely lead to more personalized and meaningful scoring of criminal defendants because of the ability of machine learning techniques to \u201czoom in\u201d on the unique details of each individual case.\n\n==\n\nSimmons 2018:\n\nTitle: Big Data, Machine Judges, and the Legitimacy of the Criminal Justice System\n\nAbstract: Predictive algorithms are rapidly spreading throughout the criminal justice system. They are used to more efficiently allocate police resources, identify potentially dangerous individuals, and advise judges at bail hearings and sentencing determinations. These algorithms have the potential to increase the accuracy, efficiency, and fairness of the criminal justice system, and they have been criticized on the grounds that they may reinforce pre-existing biases against minorities. But one aspect of these tools that has not yet been discussed in the literature is whether they will be accepted as legitimate. For centuries, these critical decisions that affect people\u2019s safety and liberty have been made by human beings; now, for the first time in human history, we are delegating large aspects of these decisions to machines. This article addresses whether people will be willing to accept this change, and if not, how we can adapt the algorithms in order to make them more acceptable. \nIn determining whether predictive algorithms are likely to be accepted by criminal defendants, the article draws on the field of procedural justice, which sets out numerous factors that determine whether a participant in a judicial proceeding believes that the process is fair. The article finds that predictive algorithms do not fare particularly well on these factors: they may not be seen as trustworthy or neutral, and they do not give defendants a significant opportunity to participate in the process. The article suggests that criminal defendants would be more likely to view predictive algorithms as legitimate if the algorithms were made more transparent, and if they were designed to ensure that they did not use data that was tainted by past discriminatory practices. \nThe article then examines whether the general population is likely to perceive predictive algorithms as legitimate. It examines various psychological barriers that people have with regard to accepting predictive algorithms. The article presents an original empirical study of six hundred individuals who were presented with a hypothetical case in which a judge uses a predictive algorithm to assist in a bail hearing. The study indicates that individuals are likely to accept predictive algorithms, as long as certain criteria are met.", "final_summary": "The advent of AI-based decision-making tools in the criminal justice system has ignited a complex debate about their implications for judicial integrity.

Thus, the present study investigated students\u2019 perceptions about AI teaching assistants in higher education by use of an online survey.

The application of AI technology to deep learning in university teachers' teaching and students' learning processes is an innovative way to promote the quality of teaching and learning. This study proposed the deep learning-based assessment to measure whether students experienced an improvement in terms of their mastery of knowledge, development of abilities, and emotional experiences. It also used comparative analysis of pre-tests and post-tests through online questionnaires to test the results. The impact of technology on teachers' teaching and students' learning processes, identified the problems in the teaching and learning processes in the context of the application of AI technology, and proposed strategies for reforming and optimizing teaching and learning. It recommends the application of software and platforms, such as Waston and Knewton, under the orientation of AI technology to improve efficiency in teaching and learning, optimize course design, and engage students in deep learning. The contribution of this research is that the teaching and learning processes will be enhanced by the use of intelligent and efficient teaching models on the teachers' side and personalized and in-depth learning on the students' side. On the one hand, the findings are helpful for teachers to better grasp the actual conditions of in-class teaching in real time, carry out intelligent lesson preparations, enrich teaching methods, improve teaching efficiency, and achieve personalized and precision teaching.

Teaching resources are far from enough and the teachers usually have great amount of works, especially in countryside or small towns. Aim to reduce the work of teachers, we developed a teaching assisting system to automatically track and recognize the motions and behaviors of students based on artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The humans are detected accurately by combing the detection results of OpenPose and human area projection method. Each person is identified by fusing his/her personal information, including the features of color, face and moving history, and tracked by using an extended particle filter method based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). By observing the students' behaviors without getting tired with the sensor system instead of the teachers, the performances and growing processes of all the students can be analyzed, referring the excellent knowledge and experiences of professional teachers. This information can be provided to the teacher which can help the teachers to adjust guidance to the students. Moreover, the information can also be provided to education robot so that the robot can also held a class or have interactions with the students.\n\n==\n\nKim 2019:\n\nTitle: Assisting Teachers with Artificial Intelligence: Investigating the Role of Teachers Using a Randomized Field Experiment\n\nAbstract: This study investigates whether artificial intelligence (AI) can transform the teacher\u2019s role by delivering personalized learning to each individual student. Conducting a randomized controlled trial in collaboration with an education company, we evaluate how providing teachers with AI assistance impacts students\u2019 academic outcomes. We find that providing AI-generated reports to teachers significantly improves students\u2019 study effort and performance, although those effects vary by teacher and class characteristics. Consistent with the organizational literature on technology and worker productivity, our findings indicate that technology overload could undermine teachers\u2019 effective use of AI coaching despite its highly accurate diagnostic ability and ready availability. Although some teachers did not utilize the AI coaching program, we found positive effects among the students of both compliers and non-compliers. We, therefore, decompose our results to identify direct and spillover effects on students\u2019 academic performance and show that failing to account for spillover effects across teachers (externality among peers) and within teachers (learning-by-doing across students) may understate the effects of AI coaching.

Cross-sectional data were collected in 2008 through a consumer survey (n=3213) in the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Sweden and the UK. Consumers\u2019 knowledge about fish generally, and about aquaculture in particular, was relatively low and differed significantly between countries. Consumers from all countries reported an indication of quality and/or food safety as an information cue when buying fish. The information sources most frequently used by Europeans were labelling and sellers in retail or supermarkets. The Internet was identified by consumers in all of the countries as one of the most important sources of information about sea and freshwater fish products. Policy makers and food marketers are encouraged to develop a simple and easily recognisable mark (relating to quality, food safety and nutrition) to assist consumer decision-making. Information campaigns focusing on issues such as the nutritional benefits of eating fish are also recommended.\n\n==\n\nBanovi\u0107 2019:\n\nTitle: \u201cOne Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish\u201d: How ethical beliefs influence consumer perceptions of \u201cblue\u201d aquaculture products?\n\nAbstract: Respecting ethical beliefs of consumers is an important precondition for food manufacturers in their attempt to improve their positioning in the European food market. Based on a cross-cultural survey of 2511 European participants, this research demonstrates how ethical beliefs affect consumer perceptions of \u201cblue\u201d (i.e. environmentally friendly) aquaculture products. The study further emphasises that the positive effect of ethical beliefs on purchase intention operates via an indirect route mediated by consumers\u2019 trust in a product category. Consumer involvement has limited moderation effect on the above relationships. To expand its \u201cblue\u201d business, a key policy recommendation to aquaculture product manufacturers and policy makers is to urge stable and reliable standards of control in environmentally responsible aquaculture production so that consumers can rely on the information source and increase their trust in aquaculture products.\n\n==\n\nVerbeke 2005:\n\nTitle: Individual determinants of fish consumption: application of the theory of planned behaviour\n\nAbstract: This study investigates individual determinants of fish consumption behaviour based on cross-sectional data collected in Belgium. Analyses show that determinants as hypothesised by the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and personal characteristics influence fish consumption intention and frequency. Favourable attitude, high subjective norm and high perceived behavioural control have a positive impact on fish consumption decisions. Significant habit effects are detected when including habit as a separate regressor of behavioural intention and behaviour. Appreciation of the attribute taste emerges as the most important driver for eating fish, followed closely by health. Bones and price constitute the negative attitude factor, which, however, does not directly reduce behavioural intention. Individual determinants pertain to gender, age, children, income, education level and region. Fish consumption frequency in compliance with health recommendations is higher among women and increases with increasing age, while the presence of children in the household leads to lower fish consumption. The lowest income class has the lowest fish consumption frequency. Higher education results in a higher intention to eat fish but has no effect on the consumption frequency itself. The coastal region of West Flanders is the region with the highest consumption. Food involvement correlates positively with fish consumption intention and frequency, whereas no significant impact of food-health awareness is found.\n\n==\n\nAitken 2020:\n\nTitle: The positive role of labelling on consumers\u2019 perceived behavioural control and intention to purchase organic food\n\nAbstract: Abstract The consumption of organic food has increased dramatically in recent years in response to consumers\u2019 concerns with issues related to health, well-being and the environment. However, further increases are restricted by a number of barriers, one of the most important of which is information. Using the Reasoned Action Approach (RAA), this study is the first to examine the role of product specific information (labelling) to understand the gap between consumer attitude and behavioural intention to purchase organic food products. Based on responses from 1,052 New Zealand consumers, analysis using structural equation modelling demonstrates that labelling plays an important role within the perceived behavioural control dimension of the RAA, as well as directly on attitudes, in influencing behavioural intention. The more that respondents agree that labelling is actionable, the more positive their attitude and sense of control, and hence intention and (self-reported) behaviour. These findings suggest that by improving labelling systems to include more actionable information, such as the health, environmental and societal benefits of products, consumers perceived behavioural control can be increased to strengthen intentions to purchase organic products.\n\n==\n\nGempesaw 1995:\n\nTitle: Consumer Perceptions of Aquaculture Products\n\nAbstract: The consumption of seafood products, including aquacultural products, significantly increased during the 1970s and 1980s. However, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, per capita seafood consumption declined. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that current per capita consumption of seafood products is estimated at around 14.9 pounds, down from a peak of 16.1 pounds in 1987 (USDA). Uncertainty in the seafood supply has contributed to retail seafood prices rising faster than prices for other meat products (Harvey). To reduce the fluctuation in retail seafood prices, there is a need to stabilize production and offer consistency in supplies. However, consistency in the seafood supply can be expected to come primarily from aquaculture because of the problems of overutilization of natural or wild stocks (United Nations). Proponents of aquaculture are advocating its commercial expansion. However, several problems must be resolved before aquaculture's potential can be achieved. The first problem lies in the biological potential of a species to survive in an aquaculture environment. The second factor deals with the consumer's willingness to buy aquaculture products. The stiff competition offered by the beef, pork, poultry, and wild fisheries industries requires the aquaculture industry to use effective marketing strategies. This study focuses on the second issue raised regar ing the willingness of consumers to purchase products obtained from either the wild fishery or aquaculture. In particular, it deals with consumer preferences for fresh finfish and shellfish products purchased for home preparation and consumption in northeastern and MidAtlantic households.\n\n==\n\nSparks 1992:\n\nTitle: An investigation into the relationship between perceived control, attitude variability and the consumption of two common foods\n\nAbstract: The study reported here takes its lead from the literatures which emphasize the importance of attitude variability and the role of perceived control over action. Within-person variability and perceptions of control are investigated in the context of people's attitudes towards the consumption of two common foods. The role of attitude ambivalence is also examined. The findings indicate that higher attitude variability is associated with weaker relationships between the components of the theory of reasoned action and that attitude variability is negatively related to perceived control. Moreover, perceived control is shown to be related to different sorts of control problem for different behaviours. It is advocated that a more in-depth assessment of attitude variability and the perceived control construct is merited and that recent calls for more serious examination of attitude ambivalence are well-founded.\n\n==\n\nHasan 2020:\n\nTitle: The Influence of Attitude, Subjective Norm and Perceived Behavioral Control towards Organic Food Purchase Intention\n\nAbstract: This study aims to determine the determinants of intention in buying organic food. This thesis focuses on the consumer of organic food products in Indonesia who use online media in Instagram to make their organic food purchases with Theory of Planned Behavior. The data collection in this study was conducted in two stages, namely pre-survey to analyze opinion leaders and types of organic foods that will be used as a limitation of the study and the second stage is the research questionnaire. The analysis technique used is qualitative data analysis. Based on the results of the study conclusions can be drawn as follows:\u00a0 adherence to organic food and perceived behavioral control significantly influence buying intention in organic food, while subjective norms are found to have no significant effect on buying intention in organic food. Attitudes toward organic food have the strongest influence among the other two variables. Subjective norms have the lowest influence. Subjective norms or pressure from other people to consume organic food apparently do not have a significant effect because it does not originate from oneself (external) or is not their own volition, in contrast to the attitude and perceived behavior control variables that originate from oneself.\n\n==\n\nAltintzoglou 2016:\n\nTitle: Fish Quality and Consumers: How Do Consumers\u2019 Knowledge About and Involvement in Fish Quality Define Factors That Influence Fish Buying Behavior?\n\nAbstract: ABSTRACT Despite recommendations, fish consumption is low in several countries. One of the many relevant factors that influence fish consumption is the quality of fish products. However, consumers differ in involvement in and knowledge about fish quality. The aim of this study was to reveal differences in involvement and knowledge about fish quality among consumers and measure how these lead to variations in the importance of factors that influence consumers when buying fresh fish fillets. We aimed to explain these results based on subjective and objective knowledge, fish consumption, and social and demographic characteristics. This study was based on data collected from 738 Norwegian consumers who responded to a questionnaire. The survey included items regarding knowledge and involvement in fish quality, objective and subjective knowledge measures, factors important when buying fish, and finally sociodemographic characteristics. This article suggests that perceived quality is one of the most important factors that influence buying behavior when it comes to fish fillet products in Norway. Consumers can have a high or low involvement with and knowledge about fish quality. However, when confronted with the decision of what fish product they may buy, most consumers reported using fish quality as a main driver.", "final_summary": "The relationship between general knowledge, awareness, and perceived behavioural control in relation to consuming food products, particularly unfamiliar low trophic level aquaculture products, is a complex interplay. \n\nPieniak (2013) found that consumers' knowledge about fish and aquaculture was relatively low, with quality and food safety being the primary concerns.

The survey is the technique of the inspection method, and survey questionnaire an instrument so that their application requests a lot of scientific and professional activities starting from the planning of survey inspections until the making of survey questionnaire, formulation and forms of questions etc. In scientific fund there are \"two general approaches of the comprehension of survey.

(1) It is the problem of an imbalance between public opinion polls and survey research. On one hand, this is due to the prevalence of public opinion polls, and on the other, the stagnation of survey re- search. This is not a healthy situation for building sociological theories. Here, I distin- guish the former as a technique that was developed based on social needs, focuses on social issues, and is oriented toward the description of people\u2019s subjective conscious- ness, as opposed to the latter, which is a technique that was developed based on aca- demic needs, to address a variety of aspects of social living, and is oriented toward the analysis of people\u2019s subjective consciousness. This paper looks at the commonalities between the two, referring to them both as the \u201cquestionnaire method.\u201d (2) There is a problem involving the heavy use, perhaps overuse, of public opinion polls and survey research, namely, the questionnaire method. Among the social phenomena that exist, there are some that can be approached using the questionnaire method and some that cannot. The current problem is that the questionnaire method is being used with too lit- tle regard to whether it is appropriate for a specific research question. (3) It is almost as if the researcher starts with the method, and then uses that method regardless of the nature of the research. Originally, a study began with observations of a subject; meth- ods for approaching that subject were then developed based on those observations. However, in the case of the questionnaire method, this American-made technique was already available, where the research needed to be conducted before observations of the various aspects of people\u2019s subjective consciousness in various societies were made. In Germany, the German expression \u201cLehne ein bisschen ab\u201d was artificially created as a survey term meant to correspond to the English phrase \u201cDisagree a little.\u201d This is a typical example of this problem. Looking at these problems, one might begin to think that the questionnaire method should be methodologically rejected, but that is not at all the case. As is the case with many kinds of tools, no method is perfect or entirely without fault. Tools must be used appropriately for their particular purposes. This is where the exploration of the poten- tial uses of the questionnaire method begins. This is an effort to \u201cconfirm the dimen- sions\u201d for the description, classification and measurement of a specific social phenome- non, namely subjective reality (people\u2019s subjective consciousness).\n\n==\n\nRobinson 2002:\n\nTitle: Ethics of questionnaires \u2014 again\n\nAbstract: In the 6 years I have been writing this column, one piece stands out as having had the greatest response. It whizzed round university campuses like wildfire. It described simple and obvious concerns about ethics in social science research (Robinson, 1996). Apparently, it came as news to many that asking questions was not necessarily harmless. Everyone, it seemed, was concocting their own little questionnaire, and because they weren\u2019t taking blood or biopsies, assumed there could be no ethical problems.

II\n\nAbstract: Having replied in the first part of this paper' to certain specific criticisms in Dr. Hoxie's \"Rejoinder,\" 2 I shall now attempt to express more positively two or three rather elementary methodological principles. I am not yet sure whether there is a real difference of judgment about them between Dr. Hoxie and myself, or whether the argument amounts only to an incident in the race-hatreds between vocabularies. In either case, no better way of approaching an understanding is in sight than the frankest possible use of the words at command on both sides. In reviewing the scope of this discussion I am impressed with the necessity of appeal to primary principles which the social sciences can hardly repudiate. As I see the situation, the occasion for such a discussion as this arises from the degree of inattention to formulation of these principles which has become habitual. It is hard to believe that responsible scholars would deliberately deny their substantial validity. I have the best of reasons for believing that Dr. Hoxie's own practice, for example, is a salutary object-lesson in consistent respect for the very principles about which we find ourselves disagreeing in the abstract. As I said in the first part of this paper, we seem to be unable to use words in a way that makes us sure of each other's ideas. The removal of the misunderstanding, I repeat, is probably not feasible through a process of logical proof. It must be chiefly through increased attention to conditions or elements of the scientific process which are out of sight when we\n\n==\n\nCoccia 2018:\n\nTitle: An Introduction to the Methods of Inquiry in Social Sciences\n\nAbstract: Abstract. The purpose of this paper is an introduction to methods for conducting inquiries in social sciences. A method of inquiry is an organized and systematic scientific approaches used by scholars for controlled investigations and experiments to efficiently solve theoretical and practical problems, generating discoveries and/or science advances. The paper here presents, briefly, the development of models of inquiry in the philosophy of science. After that, it introduces general methods of inquiry (deduction, induction, abduction and hypothetical-deductive approaches) and specific models of scientific inquiry in social sciences, such as multiple working hypotheses. In general, modern scientific research is multifaceted and requires different approaches for generating new concepts, new hypothesis and theories. Different methods of inquiry directed to solve problems in science can be complementary approaches that foster knowledge creation within and between research fields. Keywords.

Thirty-one consecutive patients with symptoms of TMD and 30 controls underwent a standardised clinical examination of the masticatory system, evaluating range of motion of the mandible, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function and pain of the TMJ and masticatory muscles. Afterwards subjects were referred for clinical examination of the cervical spine, evaluating segmental limitations, tender points upon palpation of the muscles, hyperalgesia and hypermobility. The results indicated that segmental limitations (especially at the C0\u2013C3 levels) and tender points (especially in the m. sternocleidomastoideus and m. trapezius) are significantly more present in patients than in controls.

Twenty VDT workers were recruited from laboratories. The active cervical ROM of the participants was measured and videotaped to capture the craniocervical and cervicothoracic angles using a single video camera before and after VDT work. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to quantify the linear relationship between active cervical ROM measurements and the changes in the craniocervical and cervicothoracic angles after continuous VDT work. Active neck extension (r=-0.84, p<0.01) was negatively correlated with the mean craniocervical angle, and active neck flexion (r=-0.82, p<0.01) and left lateral flexion (r=-0.67, p<0.01) were negatively correlated with the mean cervicothoracic angle.\n\n==\n\nSonnesen 2007:\n\nTitle: Cervical column morphology related to head posture, cranial base angle, and condylar malformation.\n\nAbstract: The present study describes the cervical column as related to head posture, cranial base, and mandibular condylar hypoplasia. Two groups were included in the study. The 'normal' sample comprised 21 subjects, 15 females aged 23-40 years (mean 29.2 years), and six males aged 25-44 years (mean 32.8 years) with neutral occlusion and normal craniofacial morphology. The condylar hypoplasia group comprised the lateral profile radiographs of 11 patients, eight females, and three males, aged 12-38 years (mean 21.6 years). For each individual, a profile radiograph was taken to perform a visual assessment of the morphology of the cervical column. For the normal group only, the profile radiographs were taken in the standardized head posture to measure the head posture and the cranial base angle. Cervical column: Morphological deviations of the cervical column occurred significantly more often in the subjects with condylar hypoplasia compared with the normal group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). The pattern of morphological deviations was significantly more severe in the subjects with condylar hypoplasia compared with the normal group (P < 0.01). Cervical column related to head posture and cranial base: The cervicohorizontal and cranial base angles were statistically larger in females than in males (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). No statistically significant age differences were found. Only in females was the cervical lordosis angle (OPT/CVT, P < 0.01), the inclination of the upper cervical spine (OPT/HOR, P < 0.05), and the cranial base angle (n-s-ba, P < 0.05) significantly positively correlated with fusion of the cervical column.

However, the description of cervical discs is classically taught similarly to that of the lumbar discs. Recent studies have raised this issue, and in 1999, Mercer and Bogduk described ventral annulus fibrosus as a crescent-shaped interosseous ligament. We propose a metric analysis of the different components of the cervical disc to examine this description. We analyzed 140 sagittal and coronal transections of 35 discs. These discs were taken from seven cervical spines at the five lower levels, C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6 and C6-C7. We measured quantitative parameters on sagittal, para-sagittal, ventral coronal and dorsal coronal colored transections: disc length (L), ventral annulus thickness (VAF), lateral annulus thickness (LAF), dorsal annulus thickness (DAF), length of the fibrocartilaginous tissue (FC), sagittal and coronal fibrocartilaginous core ratio (% Core) and intra-disc cleft length (Cleft). We also measured two qualitative parameters: degenerative disease of cartilaginous end plates and total intra-disc cleft. Finally, we examined 114 transections, and 18.5% were ruled out. The results showed thick ventral annulus fibrosus, thin lateral annulus and a very thin dorsal annulus. Fibrocartilaginous tissue filled the dorsal sagittal half of the disc. Intra-disc cleft split the fibrocartilaginous tissue and spread through the ventral annulus only six times. The shape of the ventral annulus at the lower cervical spine is compared to a pivot-hinge device. The aspect is functionally discussed in regard to teardrop fractures, unilateral locked facet syndrome and degenerative changes in the unco-vertebral area.\n\n==\n\nRao 2002:\n\nTitle: Neck pain, cervical radiculopathy, and cervical myelopathy: pathophysiology, natural history, and clinical evaluation.\n\nAbstract: Degenerative cervical disk disease is a ubiquitous condition that is, for the most part, asymptomatic. When symptoms do arise as a result of these degenerative changes, they can be easily grouped into axial pain, radiculopathy and myelopathy. While the pathophysiology of radiculopathy and myelopathy is better understood, the source of neck pain remains somewhat controversial. A discussion of the mechanisms of neck and suboccipital pain, and the chemical and mechanical factors responsible for neurologic symptoms is warranted. Examination of the patient with these symptoms will reveal variations in the clinical presentation. A thorough understanding of the natural history of these conditions will allow appropriate treatment to be carried out. The natural history of these conditions suggests that for the most part patients with axial symptoms are best treated without surgery, while some patients with radiculopathy will continue to be disabled by their pain, and may be candidates for surgery. Myelopathic patients are unlikely to show significant improvement, and in most cases will show stepwise deterioration. Surgical decompression and stabilization should be considered in these patients.\n\n==\n\nNakashima 2015:\n\nTitle: Cervical Disc Protrusion Correlates With the Severity of Cervical Disc Degeneration: A Cross-Sectional Study of 1211 Relatively Healthy Volunteers\n\nAbstract: Study Design. Cross-sectional study. Objective. The purposes of this study were (1) to investigate the frequency and degree of cervical disc degeneration and protrusion on cervical spine magnetic resonance (MR) images and (2) to analyze the correlation between the severity of disc degeneration and disc protrusion. Summary of Background Data. Cervical disc degenerative changes or protrusion is commonly observed on MR images in healthy subjects. However, there are few large-scale studies, and the frequency and range of these findings in healthy subjects have not been clarified. Moreover, there are no reports regarding the correlation between cervical disc degeneration and disc protrusion. Methods. Cervical disc degeneration and protrusion were prospectively measured using magnetic resonance imaging in 1211 relatively healthy volunteers. These included at least 100 males and 100 females in each decade of life between the 20s and the 70s. Cervical disc degeneration was defined according to the modified Pfirrmann classification system, and the amount of disc protrusion was evaluated using the anteroposterior diameter of disc protrusion on sagittal MR image. Results. Mild disc degeneration was very common, including 98.0% of both sexes in their 20s. The severity of cervical disc degeneration significantly increased with age in both sexes at every level. The disc degeneration predominantly occurred at C5\u2013C6 and C6\u2013C7. The difference between sexes was not significant except for individuals in their 50s. The average anteroposterior diameter of disc protrusion increased with aging, especially from the 20s to the 40s. The anteroposterior diameter of disc protrusion increased with a progression in the disc degeneration grade. Conclusion. Cervical disc degeneration and protrusion were frequently observed in healthy subjects even in their 20s and deteriorated with age. Cervical disc protrusion was significantly correlated with cervical disc degeneration, and spatial cervical disc protrusion was affected by biochemical degenerative changes as observed on MR images.

Multivariate linear regression was used to determine the effect of the influential factors on cervical alignment and total and segmental ROM.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe mean value for C2-7 cervical alignment was 21.40\u00b0 \u00b1 12.15\u00b0, and the mean value for total ROM was 63.59\u00b0 \u00b1 15.37\u00b0. Sex was a significant factor in cervical alignment, total ROM, and segmental ROM for C2-3 and C5-6 (p < 0.05). Age had a significant negative association with both the total ROM and all of the segmental ROM measurements (p < 0.05). Cervical disc degeneration at the level of interest had a significant negative association with C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7 ROM (p < 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCervical alignment in female subjects was 2.47\u00b0 lower than that in male subjects. Total ROM was 3.86\u00b0 greater in female than in male subjects and decreased 6.46\u00b0 for each decade of aging. Segmental ROM decreased 1.28\u00b0 for each decade of aging and 2.26\u00b0 for each category increase in disc degeneration at the level of interest.", "final_summary": "The relationship between cervical disc pathology and cervical posture is a complex and multifaceted issue, as evidenced by the diverse findings in the literature.\n\nC\u00e2mara-Souza (2018) found no significant relationship between cervical posture in the sagittal plane and temporomandibular disorders (TMD).

However, the abstract does not provide specific details on the relationship between cervical disc pathology and posture.\n\nNakashima (2015) found that cervical disc degeneration and protrusion were common even in healthy subjects and deteriorated with age. The study also found a significant correlation between cervical disc degeneration and disc protrusion, suggesting a potential link between disc pathology and changes in cervical posture.\n\nFinally, Liu (2015) found that cervical alignment and ROM were influenced by factors such as age, sex, and cervical disc degeneration. This suggests that these factors could also play a role in the relationship between cervical disc pathology and posture.\n\nIn conclusion, while some studies suggest a potential relationship between cervical disc pathology and cervical posture, the evidence is not conclusive, and other factors such as age, sex, and specific activities or work conditions may also play a significant role.

Although stimulant and other pharmacotherapy regimens have the most empirical support as treatments for ADHD in adults, many adults with the disorder continue to experience significant residual symptoms. In the present manuscript, we review the published studies examining group and individual psychosocial treatments for adult ADHD. We include a discussion of coaching interventions and how they differ from cognitive\u2013behavioral therapy. We conclude that the available data support the use of structured, skills-based psychosocial interventions as a viable treatment for adults with residual symptoms of ADHD. Common elements across the various treatment packages include psychoeducation, training in concrete skills (e.g., organization and planning strategies) and emphasis on outside practice and maintenance of these strategies in daily life. These treatments, however, require further study for replication, extension and refinement.

Relative to a decade ago, there has been extensive research into understanding the factors underlying ADHD, leading to far more treatment options available for both adolescents and adults with this disorder. Novel stimulant formulations have made it possible to tailor treatment to the duration of efficacy required by patients, and to help mitigate the potential for abuse, misuse and diversion. Several new non-stimulant options have also emerged in the past few years. Among these, cognitive behavioral interventions have proven popular in the treatment of adult ADHD, especially within the adult population who cannot or will not use medications, along with the many medication-treated patients who continue to show residual disability.\n\n==\n\nKnouse 2010:\n\nTitle: Current status of cognitive behavioral therapy for adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\nAbstract: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a valid and impairing psychological disorder that persists into adulthood in a majority of cases and is associated with chronic functional impairment and increased rates of comorbidity. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches for this disorder have emerged recently, and available evidence from open and randomized controlled trials suggests that these approaches are promising in producing significant symptom reduction. A conceptual model of how CBT may work for ADHD is reviewed along with existing efficacy studies. A preliminary comparison of effect sizes across intervention packages suggests that targeted learning and practice of specific behavioral compensatory strategies may be a critical active ingredient in CBT for adult ADHD.

When untreated or undertreated, it appears to have a deleterious impact upon the daily functioning of the majority of adults that were diagnosed with this condition during childhood. Effective treatment, under the best circumstances, is multi-modal. The recent MTA study staged by the United States government confirmed the primary role of psychostimulants for children with this condition. The findings from this study have been generalised to adults that also have ADHD, particularly in cases where there is a well-defined longitudinal history dating back to early childhood. Psychostimulants remain a viable first-choice strategy for adults with ADHD. There are idiosyncratic differences in response to the various psychostimulants for any given individual with ADHD. Furthermore, the emergence of long-acting, once daily psychostimulant medications is likely to improve the calibre of care for adults with ADHD. A number of alternative pharmacotherapies have been studied, or are being developed, for adults with ADHD. These pharmacotherapies include antidepressant medications that affect dopaminergic and noradrenergic bioavailability, as well as cholinergic agents. In addition, agents that manipulate histaminergic and glutaminergic receptors are being studied as possible non-stimulant alternatives in the management of adult ADHD. More information is needed before any definitive statements can be made concerning the feasibility and utility of these non-stimulant medication approaches.\n\n==\n\nBuoli 2016:\n\nTitle: Alternative pharmacological strategies for adult ADHD treatment: a systematic review\n\nAbstract: ABSTRACT Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent psychiatric condition associated with high disability and frequent comorbidity. Current standard pharmacotherapy (methylphenidate and atomoxetine) improves ADHD symptoms in the short-term, but poor data were published about long-term treatment. In addition a number of patients present partial or no response to methylphenidate and atomoxetine. Research into the main database sources has been conducted to obtain an overview of alternative pharmacological approaches in adult ADHD patients. Among alternative compounds, amphetamines (mixed amphetamine salts and lisdexamfetamine) have the most robust evidence of efficacy, but they may be associated with serious side effects (e.g. psychotic symptoms or hypertension). Antidepressants, particularly those acting as noradrenaline or dopamine enhancers, have evidence of efficacy, but they should be avoided in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder. Finally metadoxine and lithium may be particularly suitable in case of comorbid alcohol misuse or bipolar disorder.\n\n==\n\nDodson 2005:\n\nTitle: Pharmacotherapy of adult ADHD.\n\nAbstract: Although attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been officially recognized as persisting into adulthood for more than 25 years, only recently has the condition been studied in adults. There is great syndromatic continuity between childhood and adult ADHD, and thus much of the medication management of adults with ADHD can be based on the experience gained from treating children and adolescents. Stimulant medications remain the treatment of choice and are generally as effective in adults as they are in children. Several extended-release delivery systems that improve convenience and compliance have become available. Several second-line medications are also reviewed. The medications must be fine-tuned to the needs of the individual patient in regard to the dose and timing of dose that achieve optimal therapeutic benefit. Medication adjustment must be done by trial and error because no parameter yet identified predicts the molecule or dose that will provide optimal performance.\n\n==\n\nFullen 2020:\n\nTitle: Psychological Treatments in Adult ADHD: A Systematic Review\n\nAbstract: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and or impulsivity. First line treatment is medication; however, medication alone may not provide sufficient functional improvement for some patients, or be universally tolerated. A recent surge in research to treat ADHD using non-pharmacological interventions demands a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature. The aim of this review was to examine the evidence base for psychological treatments for ADHD management in adulthood. A systematic search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, PubMed, and EMBASE was undertaken until January 2019 for peer-reviewed articles exploring psychological interventions for adults (18\u00a0years with no upper limit) diagnosed with ADHD. A total of 53 papers were identified for inclusion. Collectively, 92% of studies (employing various non-pharmacological interventions) found a variant of significant positive effect on either primary or secondary outcomes associated with ADHD. The strongest empirical support derived from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy interventions. In addition, findings indicated support for the effectiveness of Mindfulness, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Neurofeedback. Other types of interventions also demonstrated effectiveness; however, support was limited due to lack of available research and methodological rigor. Psychological interventions should be considered a valid and useful addition to clinical practice. Implications and areas for future research are discussed.\n\n==\n\nPrince 2002:\n\nTitle: Pharmacotherapy of Adult ADHD\n\nAbstract: This chapter explains pharmacotherapy of adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The aggregate literature supports the notion that pharmacotherapy provides an effective treatment for adults with ADHD. Effective pharmacological treatments for ADHD adults include the use of the psychostimulants and antidepressants, with unclear efficacy of cognitive enhancers. Structured psychotherapy may be effective when used adjunctly with medications. Groups focused on coping skills, support, and interpersonal psychotherapy may also be very useful for these adults. For adults considering advanced schooling, educational planning, and alterations in the school environment may be necessary. Further controlled investigations assessing the efficacy of single and combination agents for adults with ADHD are necessary, with careful attention to diagnostics, symptom ,and neuropsychological outcome, long-term tolerability and efficacy, and use in specific ADHD subgroups. The chapter concludes that further studies applying stringent diagnostic criteria and outcome methodology are necessary to enhance the range of pharmacotherapeutic options for adults with ADHD.", "final_summary": "The recent advances and therapeutic approaches to Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have been extensively studied, with a focus on both pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. \n\nPharmacological treatments remain a primary approach, with stimulant medications being the treatment of choice (Dodson, 2005).

In the coal bio-desulphurization, jarosite mediated by microorganisms decreases the bacterial absorbability of nutrients, occupies the available sites of coal surfaces, ultimately results in residual sulfur, which cannot be removed from coal. The thiobacillus ferrooxidans cultivation conditions with minimal jarosite in 9K medium by varying the initial pH, the initial Fe2+ concentration and the applied potential were studied and determined. Experimental results show that the optimal combination giving the minimal jarosite precipitates (3.73 g/L) and the good growing activity of bacteria is the initial pH of 1.6\u20131.7 with the Fe2+ concentration of 9\u201310 g/L and the applied potential of \u22120.5 V for 7 hours.

The main goal of this research was evaluate the effect of polysaccharides (dextrine) on both the bacterial cells and precipitated jarosite particles deposition onto the mineral surface. The determination of the free energy of solid surface was med. by means of the thin-layer wicking technique. It was found that the quartz particles which were covered by the dextrine film have value of \u03b3 LW =121.44 mN/m (without dextrin \u03b3 LW =62.18 mN/m). The adsorption of dextrin caused a decrease of the \u03b3 \u2212 component of the free energy from 171.90 to 123.19 mN/m. The treatment of both quartz and gold refractory ore by polysaccharides caused an increase of the adhesion of microbial cells and jarosite colloid particles.

Jarosite forms in low temperature hydrothermal, acidic, sulfate-rich environments often yielding a range of elemental substituted forms: plumbojarosite (M = Pb), argentojarosite (M = Ag), jarosite (M = K), natrojarosite (M = Na), hydroniumjarosite (M = H3O), and ammoniojarosite (M = NH4). Anthropogenic sources of jarosite are common in mine waste environments, most often associated with the waste products resulting from base metal recovery. Few studies have investigated the effect that dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria may have in the presence of these compounds following the onset of reducing conditions. Jarosite reactivity may differ systematically as a function of its chemical properties. For example, the incorporation of Ag in the mineral lattice may have inhibitory affects on the growth of microbial strains. In this study the reductive dissolution of argentojarosite (M = Ag) in the presence of Shewanella putrefaciens CN32 (10 9 cells ml 1 , pH 7.1) was examined. Using the silver (argento)jarosite, Ag Fe 3 (SO 4 ) 2 (OH) 6 , as a sole terminal electron acceptor we observed the reduction of structural Fe(III) and Ag(I) by CN32 through the release of Fe(II) ions to solution. Aqueous silver concentrations were below instrumental detection. Environmental SEM (ESEM) and TEM micrographs of the microbial clusters revealed the progressive heterogeneous nucleation of Ag(0) nanoparticles within cellular structures and also on adjacent mineral grains. The results of this study are the first presented for the anaerobic dissolution of silver jarosite. This has implications for understanding the processes leading to the mobility or retention of silver in mine waste and industrial landfill environments. It also provides insight into the microbial mechanisms of silver resistance and nanoparticle formation with potential applications for bioleaching and/or biotechnology.\n\n==\n\nSasaki 2006:\n\nTitle: FE-SEM Study of Microbially Formed Jarosites by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans\n\nAbstract: Morphological characterization of jarosite groups formed from Fe(III) biologically oxidized with different numbers of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was conducted using FE-SEM. The higher population of A. ferrooxidans resulted in more distinct jarosite mineral shape, and stronger Raman intensities for potassium jarosite, ammoniojarosite and argentojarosite. The morphology of the jarosites might be dependent on iron-oxidizing activity of A. ferrooxidans. The technique was applied to identify jarosite compounds formed during microbially mediated dissolution of arsenopyrite by A. ferrooxidans. It is difficult to identify this jarosite compound by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy because amounts are typically low and the crystallization is poor in minerals formed by microbially mediated oxidation. However, FE-SEM image provided helpful information for identification of jarosite compounds. The results suggest that morphology would provide useful information for identification and history of jarosite minerals as geochemical samples.\n\n==\n\nDaoud 2006:\n\nTitle: Formation of jarosite during Fe2+ oxidation by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans\n\nAbstract: Abstract Jarosite precipitation is a very important phenomenon that is observed in many bacterial cultures. In many applications involving Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans , like coal desulphurization and bioleaching, it is crucial to minimize jarosite formation in order to increase efficiency. The formation of jarosite during the oxidation of ferrous iron by free suspended cells of A. ferrooxidans was studied. The process was studied as a function of time, pH and temperature. The main parameter affecting the jarosite formation was pH. Several experiments yielded results showing oxidation rates as high as 0.181\u20130.194\u00a0g/L\u00a0h, with low jarosite precipitation of 0.0125\u20130.0209\u00a0g at conditions of pH 1.6\u20131.7 with an operating temperature of 35\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n==\n\nGao 2019:\n\nTitle: Reductive dissolution of jarosite by a sulfate reducing bacterial community: Secondary mineralization and microflora development.\n\nAbstract: Jarosite is an iron-hydroxysulfate mineral commonly found in acid mine drainage (AMD). Given its strong adsorption capacity and its ability to co-precipitation with heavy metals, jarosite is considered a potent scavenger of contaminants in AMD-impacted environments. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) play an important role in the reductive dissolution of jarosite; however, the mechanism involved has yet to be elucidated. In this study, an indigenous SRB community enriched from the Dabaoshan mine area (Guangdong, China) was employed to explore the mechanism of the microbial reduction of jarosite. Different cultures, with or without dissolved sulfate and the physical separation of jarosite from bacteria by dialysis bags, were examined. Results indicate that the reduction of jarosite by SRB occurred via an indirect mechanism. In systems with dissolved sulfate, lactate was incompletely oxidized to acetate coupled with the reduction of SO42- to S2-, which subsequently reduced the Fe3+ in jarosite, forming secondary minerals including vivianite, mackinawite and pyrite. In systems without dissolved sulfate, jarosite dissolution occurred prior to reduction, and similar secondary minerals formed as well. Extracellular polymeric substances secreted by SRB appeared to facilitate the release of sulfate from jarosite. Structural sulfate in the solid phase of jarosite may not be available for SRB respiration. Although direct contact between SRB and jarosite is not necessary for mineral reduction, wrapping jarosite into dialysis bags suppressed the reduction to a certain extent. Microbial community composition differed in direct contact treatments and physical separation treatments. Physical separation of the SRB community from jarosite mineral supported the growth of Citrobacter, while Desulfosporosinus dominated in direct contact treatments.\n\n==\n\nJones 2014:\n\nTitle: Synthesis and properties of ternary (K, NH\u2084, H\u2083O)-jarosites precipitated from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans cultures in simulated bioleaching solutions.\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this study was to synthesize a series of solid solution jarosites by biological oxidation of ferrous iron at pH2.2-4.4 and ambient temperature in media containing mixtures of K(+) (0, 1, 4, 6, 12, 31 mM) and NH4(+) (6.1, 80, 160, 320 mM). The starting material was a liquid medium for Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans comprised of 120 mM FeSO4 solution and mineral salts at pH2.2. Following inoculation with A. ferrooxidans, the cultures were incubated in shake flasks at 22\u00b0C. As bacteria oxidized ferrous iron, ferric iron hydrolyzed and precipitated as jarosite-group minerals (AFe3(SO4)2(OH)6) and/or schwertmannite (idealized formula Fe8O8(OH)6(SO4)\u00b7nH2O). The precipitates were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), elemental analysis, and Munsell color. Schwertmannite was the dominant mineral product at low combinations of K(+) (\u2264 4 mM) and NH4(+) (\u2264 80 mM) in the media. At higher single or combined concentrations, yellowish jarosite phases were produced, and Munsell hue provided a sensitive means of detecting minor schwertmannite in the oxidation products. Although the hydrated ionic radii of K(+) and NH4(+) are similar, K(+) greatly facilitated the formation of a jarosite phase compared to NH4(+). Unit cell and cell volume calculations from refinements of the powder XRD patterns indicated that the jarosite phases produced were mostly ternary (K, NH4, H3O)-solid solutions that were also deficient in structural Fe, especially at low NH4 contents. Thus, ferric iron precipitation from the simulated bioleaching systems yielded solid solutions of jarosite with chemical compositions that were dependent on the relative concentrations of K(+) and NH4(+) in the synthesis media. No phase separations involving discrete, end-member K-jarosite or NH4-jarosite were detected in the un-aged precipitates.\n\n==\n\nGrishin 1988:\n\nTitle: Characterization of Jarosite Formed upon Bacterial Oxidation of Ferrous Sulfate in a Packed-Bed Reactor\n\nAbstract: A packed-bed bioreactor with activated-carbon particles as a carrier matrix material inoculated with Thiobacillus ferrooxidans was operated at a pH of 1.35 to 1.5 to convert ferrous sulfate to ferric sulfate. Despite the low operating pH, trace amounts of precipitates were produced in both the reactor and the oxidized effluent. X-ray diffraction and chemical analyses indicated that the precipitates were well-ordered potassium jarosite. The chemical analyses also revealed a relative deficiency of Fe and an excess of S in the reactor sample compared with the theoretical composition of potassium jarosite.", "final_summary": "Microbial activity has a significant impact on the surface properties of jarosite precipitate, a common mineral found in acid mine drainage.

In recent years, the Communist Party of Vietnam and the Government of Vietnam have strengthened their efforts to prevent and fight corruption. Despite strong anti-corruption measures being implemented at the national level, provincial authorities have shied away from tackling corruption. One of the reasons for this could be that it is not clear to provincial authorities if and how corruption is affecting local development economically and socially. This article demonstrates that corruption has a negative impact on private sector investment, employment and per capita income at the provincial level in Vietnam. However, corruption is found to have no significant impact on how income is distributed across provinces. The findings demonstrate that more effective anti-corruption measures are necessary to promote the private sector and improve household income.

In this paper, we use a novel empirical strategy, drawn from research in experimental psychology, to test the linkage between foreign direct investment (FDI) and corruption. The prevailing literature has produced confused and contradictory results on this vital relationship due to errors in their measurement of corruption which are correlated with FDI inflows. When a less biased operationalization is employed, we find clear evidence of corruption during both registration and procurement procedures in Vietnam. The prevalence of corruption, however, is not associated with inflows of FDI. On the contrary, one measure of economic openness appears to be the most important driver of reductions in Vietnamese corruption: the wave of domestic legislation, which accompanied the country's bilateral trade liberalization agreement with the United States (US-BTA), significantly reduced bribery during business registration.\n\n==\n\nPhuonga 2020:\n\nTitle: Corruption and long-term investment of businesses in Vietnam\n\nAbstract: Article history: Received: June 13 2020 Received in revised format: June 24 2020 Accepted: June 26 2020 Available online: June 26 2020 This paper investigates the effects of corruption and long-term investment of businesses in Vietnam using the General Least Square (GLS) estimation method for businesses in 63 provinces in Vietnam from 2016-2018. The results show that corruption was an important factor affecting the long-term investment decisions of Vietnamese enterprises. The ability to predict corruption of businesses can explain the phenomenon of part of the cash flow of businesses flowing out of production and business. Informal costs related to low-level administrative procedures act as \u201cgrease\u201d to help businesses reduce time costs, but when the total amount of unofficial expenses exceeds 10% of revenue of businesses, they become a burden for businesses and restrain them from making long-term investments.

It is motivated by two separate but related considerations. First, despite the seriousness of the phenomenon of corruption, there is a paucity of rigorous empirical research of corruption, particularly tax corruption, in Vietnam. Secondly, ineffective control of corruption is viewed as a cause of Vietnam\u2019s recent total factor productivity (TFP) slowdown or its poor industrial policy, both of which may hamper Vietnam\u2019s progress as a low middle-income country. Without some understanding on the impact of tax corruption on the economy, it may not be possible to devise the most effective anti-corruption policy and measures. After a brief literature review that focuses on tax corruption, various conceptual issues relating to tax corruption are discussed and clarified.

However, compared to other countries around the world, the corruption in Vietnam is still a national problem. The number of corruption cases may decline, but the scale and severity has been increasing. Many cases has involved high-ranking officials in the government with more than 20 general officers in the armed forces to be sentenced. On the basis of analysing the current situation of corruption in recent years, the author hereby recommends some synchronous solutions to improve the effectiveness of anti-corruption.\n\n==\n\nPhuong 2017:\n\nTitle: Corruption in Vietnam: The current situation and proposed solutions\n\nAbstract: Abstract This chapter introduces an overview of corruption in Vietnam. Although the country\u2019s GDP has maintained a steady growth of around 5%\u20137% per year during 2011\u201315, corruption is widespread throughout Vietnam and remains a substantial issue. The chapter starts by defining corruption according to Vietnamese law and regulations. It then explains the three major characteristics of corruption as perceived in this country. The third section of the chapter lists the 12 acts of corruption and the current state of corruption in Vietnam. The chapter ends with recommendations and solutions to prevent corruption in Vietnam. The critical roles played by ethical government officials, managers, and employees to prevent and punish corruption and bribery, along with effective legislation, will create and contribute toward sustainable economic development in the country.\n\n==\n\nBaum:\n\nTitle: Tax corruption and private sector development in Vietnam *\n\nAbstract: This article aims to examine the impact of tax corruption on private sector development in Vietnam. It is motivated by two separate but related considerations. First, despite the seriousness of the phenomenon of corruption, there is a paucity of rigorous empirical research of corruption, particularly tax corruption, in Vietnam. Secondly, ineffective control of corruption is viewed as a cause of Vietnam\u2019s recent total factor productivity (TFP) slowdown or its poor industrial policy, both of which may hamper Vietnam\u2019s progress as a low middle-income country. Without some understanding on the impact of tax corruption on the economy, it may not be possible to devise the most effective anti-corruption policy and measures. After a brief literature review that focuses on tax corruption, various conceptual issues relating to tax corruption are discussed and clarified. The extent of petty tax corruption in Vietnam is then discussed, followed by a review of findings and implications of recent studies on how tax corruption impacts on private sector development in Vietnam. Despite perceptions and evidence of widespread petty tax corruption, Vietnam ranks very highly both in terms of tax collection and tax effort. Not unexpectedly, the impact of tax corruption is mixed in the sense that empirical evidence lends credence to both \u2018sanding the wheels\u2019 and \u2018greasing the wheels\u2019 hypotheses. Finally, some broad policy recommendations for combating tax corruption are offered.", "final_summary": "Corruption in Vietnam is a complex issue with implications for the country's economic landscape. Salvador (2020) suggests that corruption can influence the competitive conditions among firms, which could indirectly impact foreign investment. Dang (2016) provides evidence that corruption has a negative impact on private sector investment and per capita income at the provincial level in Vietnam, indicating a potential inefficiency in resource allocation.\n\nThe relationship between corruption and foreign direct investment (FDI) is nuanced. Malesky (2012) found no direct association between the prevalence of corruption and inflows of FDI in Vietnam. Instead, the study suggests that other factors, such as domestic legislation and trade liberalization, may play a significant role in business practices.\n\nPhuonga (2020) found that corruption influences the business decisions of Vietnamese enterprises, particularly in relation to long-term investments. This is echoed by Nguyen (2017) and Baum (year not provided), who both found that tax corruption impacts private sector development in Vietnam, although the specific effects vary.\n\nDespite efforts to combat corruption, it remains a significant issue in Vietnam. Thao (2020) notes that the scale and severity of corruption cases have been increasing, even involving high-ranking officials. However, the specific impact of this on the overall severity of corruption in Vietnam, as suggested by Phuong (2017), is not explicitly stated.\n\nIn conclusion, while corruption in Vietnam is a pervasive issue with potential implications for the country's economy, its specific impact on foreign investment, private sector development, and long-term investment decisions is complex and influenced by a variety of factors. Further research and effective anti-corruption measures are necessary to fully understand and address this issue."}, {"query": "long text classification", "paper_list_string": "Weijie 2021:\n\nTitle: Long Text Classification Based on BERT\n\nAbstract: Existing text classification algorithms generally have limitations in terms of text length and yield poor classification results for long texts.

A long text classification model based on multi-feature weighted fusion is proposed for the problems of contextual semantic relations, long-distance global relations, and multi-sense words in long text classification tasks. The BERT model is used to obtain feature representations containing global semantic and contextual feature information of text, convolutional neural networks to obtain features at different levels and combine attention mechanisms to obtain weighted local features, fuse global contextual features with weighted local features, and obtain classification results by equal-length convolutional pooling. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms other models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 value, etc., under the same data set conditions compared with traditional deep learning classification models, and it can be seen that the model has more obvious advantages in long text classification.\n\n==\n\nZang 2023:\n\nTitle: Long Text Multi-label Classification\n\nAbstract: In recent years, the evaluation of non-technical literacy such as sense of worth, outlook on life, and sustainable development concept, has become increasingly important in university education in China. They are often evaluated by questionnaires or interviews. However, the feedback texts from students often contain long paragraphs of students' opinion responses in Chinese, with long text, large amount of information and complex structure, which reduce the accuracy of long Chinese text classification. In this paper, we propose a multi-label classification model named MLformer, which uses the Longformer model to obtain feature representations containing information about the global semantic and local contextual features of the text to effectively classify students' views. The experimental results on our long text dataset in Chinese about engineering sustainability show that our method outperforms the typical deep learning classification model BERT in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1 score, thus, it can provide a powerful reference for students' opinion analysis and evaluation.\n\n==\n\nTang 2023:\n\nTitle: Research on multi-label long text classification algorithm based on transformer-LDA\n\nAbstract: Text classification is an important research area in the field of natural language processing. In view of the low efficiency of the traditional CNN and RNN algorithms for multi-label classification of long text due to timing and spatial displacement problems, this paper proposes a long text classification model with improved Transformer attention mechanism, and combines LDA topic classification algorithm to achieve multi-label classification of document length text. Firstly, the paper introduces the industry's solutions to the problem of multi-classification of long texts. Compared with traditional algorithms such as truncation method and pooling method, the PAPER proposes the LDA topic classification model combined with the improved Transformer-XL text classification model to extract text features with fine granularity, so as to classify texts with higher accuracy. Finally, comparative experiments show that the proposed solution has a significant improvement in P value, R value and F1 value compared with the traditional classification method in the field of long text multi-label classification.\n\n==\n\nFiok 2021:\n\nTitle: Revisiting Text Guide, a Truncation Method for Long Text Classification\n\nAbstract: The quality of text classification has greatly improved with the introduction of deep learning, and more recently, models using attention mechanism. However, to address the problem of classifying text instances that are longer than the length limit adopted by most of the best performing transformer models, the most common method is to naively truncate the text so that it meets the model limit. Researchers have proposed other approaches, but they do not appear to be popular, because of their high computational cost and implementation complexity. Recently, another method called Text Guide has been proposed, which allows for text truncation that outperforms the naive approach and simultaneously is less complex and costly than earlier proposed solutions. Our study revisits Text Guide by testing the influence of certain modifications on the method\u2019s performance. We found that some aspects of the method can be altered to further improve performance and confirmed several assumptions regarding the dependence of the method\u2019s quality on certain factors.\n\n==\n\nFiok 2021:\n\nTitle: Text Guide: Improving the Quality of Long Text Classification by a Text Selection Method Based on Feature Importance\n\nAbstract: The performance of text classification methods has improved greatly over the last decade for text instances of less than 512 tokens. This limit has been adopted by most state-of-the-research transformer models due to the high computational cost of analyzing longer text instances. To mitigate this problem and to improve classification for longer texts, researchers have sought to resolve the underlying causes of the computational cost and have proposed optimizations for the attention mechanism, which is the key element of every transformer model. In our study, we are not pursuing the ultimate goal of long text classification, i.e., the ability to analyze entire text instances at one time while preserving high performance at a reasonable computational cost. Instead, we propose a text truncation method called Text Guide, in which the original text length is reduced to a predefined limit in a manner that improves performance over naive and semi-naive approaches while preserving low computational costs. Text Guide benefits from the concept of feature importance, a notion from the explainable artificial intelligence domain. We demonstrate that Text Guide can be used to improve the performance of recent language models specifically designed for long text classification, such as Longformer. Moreover, we discovered that parameter optimization is the key to Text Guide performance and must be conducted before the method is deployed. Future experiments may reveal additional benefits provided by this new method.\n\n==\n\nHe 2011:\n\nTitle: Research on short text classification for web forum\n\nAbstract: The unique characteristic of short text makes short text classification quite different from traditional long text processing. The feature space of short text is so sparse, which makes it notoriously difficult to extract sufficient and effective features. In this paper, aiming to classify the short text on web forum accurately, a novel short-text-processing method based on semantic extension is introduced to enhance the content of the original short text, which effectively solves the problem of feature sparse. In addition, we put forward the concept of Key-Pattern (KP) and propose a new text feature representation approach based on KP, which extracts phrase with powerful semantic information as the text features. Traditional classifier model are applied to estimate the text's classification, experimental results show that the proposed method is effective to improve the accuracy and recall of short text classification.", "final_summary": "Long text classification is a complex task in the field of natural language processing, with various studies proposing different methods to tackle this challenge. \n\nWeijie (2021) proposed a BERT-based method that slices long text into smaller segments, encodes them using BERT, and then fuses the local semantic information using BiLSTM.

The theory of good water governance could provide inspirations for properly dealing with the water challenges of these areas. The integrated water resources management, the environmental water flow protection and the public participation are three major requirements of the good water governance. There are three major challenges for promoting the good water governance. The first is related to the clarification of the responsibilities of the water governance. The second is about balancing the diversified water needs. The third is about the optimal approach for improving the public participation.

Somewhat surprisingly in light of this attention, there is widespread confusion about the meaning of the term \u201cwater governance\u201d. This paper reviews the history of the term's use and misuse to reveal how the concept is frequently inflated to include issues that go well beyond governance. Further, it highlights how calls to improve water governance often espouse predetermined goals that should instead be the very function of water governance to define. To help overcome this confusion, the paper suggests a more refined definition of water governance and related qualities of good water governance that are consistent with broader notions of the concepts.

As this does not depend only on formal institutional factors, such as legislation and organizational structure, there are also references to dynamic conditions, such as socioeconomic circumstances and the quality of the administration, summarized in the concept of governance, understood as the capability of a social system to mobilize energies, in a coherent manner, for the sustainable development of water resources. As human society becomes ever more complex and the intensity of human impact on natural resources becomes more severe, the need to integrate the different elements of water management becomes imperative. It is for this reason that effective water governance will be more and more closely linked to integrated water resources management. The specific objectives of this paper are: (i); to contribute to focusing the regional debate on those aspects of water institutions and macroeconomic policies which are particularly critical for Latin American and Caribbean countries; (ii); to promote the formulation of a regional position that genuinely reflects its situation, visions, aspirations and problems; (iii); to promote a critical and balanced analysis of legislation, regulatory frameworks and public policies for water resources management and provision of related public services; and (iv); to make available in English a summary of the water-related research carried out by the Division of Natural Resources and Infrastructure of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC);.\n\n==\n\nFranks 2007:\n\nTitle: Water governance and poverty\n\nAbstract: This paper engages with policy on meeting development goals for water through interventions, which promote good governance.

Adopting this paradigm effectively, therefore, requires an understanding of the challenges, best practices and available solutions for collaboration among these functional teams. However, collaborative aspects related to these teams have received very little empirical attention in the DevSecOps literature. Hence, we present a study focusing on a key security activity, Application Security Testing (AST), in which practitioners face difficulties performing collaborative work in a DevSecOps environment. Our study made novel use of 48 systematically selected webinars, technical talks and panel discussions as a data source to qualitatively analyse software practitioner discussions on the most recent trends and emerging solutions in this highly evolving field. We find that the lack of features that facilitate collaboration built into the AST tools themselves is a key tool-related challenge in DevSecOps. In addition, the lack of clarity related to role definitions, shared goals, and ownership also hinders Collaborative AST (CoAST). We also captured a range of best practices for collaboration (e.g., Shift-left security), emerging communication methods (e.g., ChatOps), and new team structures (e.g., hybrid teams) for CoAST.

As of today, DevOps concepts have been primarily introduced to ensure a constant flow of features and bug fixes into new releases from a functional perspective. In order to integrate a non-functional perspective into these DevOps concepts this report focuses on tools, activities, and processes to ensure one of the most important quality attributes of a software system, namely performance. \nPerformance describes system properties concerning its timeliness and use of resources. Common metrics are response time, throughput, and resource utilization. Performance goals for EAs are typically defined by setting upper and/or lower bounds for these metrics and specific business transactions. In order to ensure that such performance goals can be met, several activities are required during development and operation of these systems as well as during the transition from Dev to Ops. Activities during development are typically summarized by the term Software Performance Engineering (SPE), whereas activities during operations are called Application Performance Management (APM). SPE and APM were historically tackled independently from each other, but the newly emerging DevOps concepts require and enable a tighter integration between both activity streams. This report presents existing solutions to support this integration as well as open research challenges in this area.\n\n==\n\nMao 2020:\n\nTitle: Preliminary Findings about DevSecOps from Grey Literature\n\nAbstract: Context: Emerging from the agile culture, DevOps particularly emphasizes development and deployment speed to achieve rapid value delivery, which however brings some security risks to the software development process. DevSecOps is an extension of DevOps, which is considered as a means to intertwine development, operation and security. Some companies with security concerns begin to take DevSecOps into consideration when it comes to the application of DevOps. Objective: The goal of this study is to report the state-of-the-practice of DevSecOps as well as calling for academia to pay more attention to DevSecOps. Method: Using Google search engine to collect articles on DevSecOps, we conducted a Grey Literature Review (GLR) on the selected articles. Results: Whilst there exists three major software security risks in DevOps, the establishment of DevOps pipeline provides opportunities for software security activities. Based on the preliminary consensus that DevSecOps is an extension of DevOps, it is observed that the interpretations of DevSecOps can be classified into three core aspects, which are: DevSecOps capabilities, cultural enablers, and technological enablers. Furthermore, to materialize the interpretations into daily software production activities, the recommended DevSecOps practices we obtain from Grey Literature (GL) can be categorized in terms of process, infrastructure and collaboration. Conclusion: Although DevSecOps is getting increasing attention by industry, it is still in its infancy and needs to be promoted by both academia and industry.\n\n==\n\nMohan 2016:\n\nTitle: SecDevOps: Is It a Marketing Buzzword? - Mapping Research on Security in DevOps\n\nAbstract: DevOps is changing the way organizations develop and deploy applications and service customers. Many organizations want to apply DevOps, but they are concerned by the security aspects of the produced software. This has triggered the creation of the terms SecDevOps and DevSecOps. These terms refer to incorporating security practices in a DevOps environment by promoting the collaboration between the development teams, the operations teams, and the security teams. This paper surveys the literature from academia and industry to identify the main aspects of this trend. The main aspects that we found are: definition, security best practices, compliance, process automation, tools for SecDevOps, software configuration, team collaboration, availability of activity data and information secrecy. Although the number of relevant publications is low, we believe that the terms are not buzzwords, they imply important challenges that the security and software communities shall address to help organizations develop secure software while applying DevOps processes.\n\n==\n\nAlawneh 2022:\n\nTitle: Expanding DevSecOps Practices and Clarifying the Concepts within Kubernetes Ecosystem\n\nAbstract: DevSecOps principles and practices come with promising futures, which are related to integrating security by design within organizational processes. These include development, deployment, and operational management. For example, DevSecOps practices help securely speed up the processes of application delivery; resilience; elasticity; availability, and re-liability. Despite the promising future of DevSecOps, it comes with several challenges, and one of these is about establishing robust mechanisms for integrating security by design within the existing DevOps practices. This paper unifies and redefines DevSecOps practices, and then provides several real-life examples clarifying what it means to integrate security by design within each practice. Finally, it clarifies the concepts by illustrating the roles of DevSecOps practices in securing the Kubernetes ecosystem.\n\n==\n\nRajapakse 2022:\n\nTitle: Challenges and solutions when adopting DevSecOps: A systematic review\n\nAbstract: Abstract Context: DevOps (Development and Operations) has become one of the fastest-growing software development paradigms in the industry. However, this trend has presented the challenge of ensuring secure software delivery while maintaining the agility of DevOps. The efforts to integrate security in DevOps have resulted in the DevSecOps paradigm, which is gaining significant interest from both industry and academia. However, the adoption of DevSecOps in practice is proving to be a challenge. Objective: This study aims to systemize the knowledge about the challenges faced by practitioners when adopting DevSecOps and the proposed solutions reported in the literature. We also aim to identify the areas that need further research in the future. Method: We conducted a Systematic Literature Review of 54 peer-reviewed studies. The thematic analysis method was applied to analyze the extracted data. Results: We identified 21 challenges related to adopting DevSecOps, 31 specific solutions, and the mapping between these findings. We also determined key gap areas in this domain by holistically evaluating the available solutions against the challenges. The results of the study were classified into four themes: People, Practices, Tools, and Infrastructure. Our findings demonstrate that tool-related challenges and solutions were the most frequently reported, driven by the need for automation in this paradigm. Shift-left security and continuous security assessment were two key practices recommended for DevSecOps. People-related factors were considered critical for successful DevSecOps adoption but less studied. Conclusions: We highlight the need for developer-centered application security testing tools that target the continuous practices in DevSecOps. More research is needed on how the traditionally manual security practices can be automated to suit rapid software deployment cycles. Finally, achieving a suitable balance between the speed of delivery and security is a significant issue practitioners face in the DevSecOps paradigm.\n\n==\n\nRajapakse 2022:\n\nTitle: Challenges and solutions when adopting DevSecOps: A systematic review\n\nAbstract: Abstract Context: DevOps (Development and Operations) has become one of the fastest-growing software development paradigms in the industry.

Modularization has allowed breaking monolithic application into independent components that can be developed faster and automation in CICD has enabled high velocity deployment of applications to the cloud. Such a modernization has mandated a need to put security at the center of the workflow from code to container, giving rise to the DevSecOps paradigms. Although effectiveness of the existing DevSecOps solutions is limited by lack of good development practices and narrow scope where it is applied for security analytic only around code hygiene, like vulnerability scanning, license auditing, etc. We discuss our survey on these challenges and highlight their security implications.

The Lower Middle Class Revisited\n\nAbstract: The lower middle class has long had a bad press, for in common with other subaltern groups it has been more represented from without than within. Thus Victorian writers faced with the disquieting irruption of a new breed of petty bourgeois shop and office workers devised a parodic discourse of littleness, whose feminized tropes rendered the clerk as socially insignificant as the sequestered Victorian woman. George Grossmith's comic classic, Diary of a Nobody, pilloried the new social type in Mr. Pooter, whose smaller-than-life adventures stood for all that was ineffectual, pretentious, and banal in his class. Social commentators held the lower middle class responsible for the degeneration of civilization itself, stifled by their suburban respectability and addiction to mass culture. In Howard's End, E. M. Forster drew the clerk, Leonard Bast, with some sympathy but made him the book's major casualty, while belittling a class whose education was learned \u201cfrom the outside of books.\u201d In the interwar years the Marxist poet Christopher Caudwell likened the petty bourgeois world to \u201ca terrible stagnant marsh, all mud and bitterness, without even the saving grace of tragedy.\u201d George Orwell's fictional antihero from the same period, the insurance salesman George Bowling, characterizes the men of his class as \u201cTories, yes-men and bumsuckers.\u201d It is still hard to hide a certain relish in repeating such charges, for putting the boot in on the lower middle class has long been the intellectual's blood sport, an exorcism, so we are told, of the guilty secret so many of us share as closet petit bourgeois denying our own class origins.\n\n==\n\nFernald 2005:\n\nTitle: A Feminist Public Sphere? Virginia Woolf's Revisions of the Eighteenth Century\n\nAbstract: Since the historicist turn in scholarship on modernism, critics have focused on the ways modernist writers have marketed themselves. The modernist writers who expressed disdain for mass culture have been shown to have used and depended on the tools of advertising, marketing, professionalization, and self-promotion that was provided by mass culture. Thus, Peter McDonald argues that \u201cthe cultural divisions between the high-class reviews and the illustrated monthlies were not always as rigid as might be supposed,\u201d and Lawrence Rainey asserts that modernist publishing depended upon an intermediate economic stage, such as an early limited or subscription-based edition, during which a text\u2019s cultural value rose, potentially helping create demand for broader sales.1 When this sociohistorical approach focuses on a single writer\u2019s career, it shows how he or she fits into, or, more often, attempts to subvert or challenge the cultural categories of high, low, and middlebrow. Virginia Woolf was, of course, a woman, and thus something of an outsider in the London literary scene; she was also the daughter of Victorian man-of-letters and editor Leslie Stephen, and thus, the ultimate insider. This combination makes her career an ideal case for further study. As one recent critic puts it, \u201cWoolf entered public discourse by the side door.\u201d2\n\n==\n\nDaugherty 2006:\n\nTitle: \"You See You Kind of Belong to Us, and What You Do Matters Enormously\": Letters from Readers to Virginia Woolf\n\nAbstract: Writing to Virginia Woolf about Three Guineas from Springfield, MA in 1938, Agnes K. Potter says her comments are from \"the point of view of this ordinary reader\" (Snaith, \"Three Guineas Letters\" 97). Q. D. Leavis, however, would have us believe that Woolf did not have ordinary readers; Three Guineas \"is a conversation between [Woolf] and her friends\" (272). Woolf's careful and honest description of her class position leads to Leavis's assumption that all Woolf's readers must be of Woolf's own class. Anna Snaith's edition of the letters written to Woolf after the publication of Three Guineas proves that such a narrow construction of Woolf's readership is not accurate. (1) Similarly, Melba Cuddy-Keane's investigations of the readers \"spotting\" The Common Reader (Virginia Woolf 110-14) and of individual readers like John Farrelly (\"From Fan-Mail\" 3-32) succeed in \"break[ing] down categories that have identified high culture with high class\" and show that definitions of Woolf's readership must include respect for \"both the intellectual impulse and the intellectual accomplishment of non-privileged, non-specialist readers\" (\"Imbricated\" 5). Following Q. D. Leavis's lead, however, Jonathan Rose recently argues that Woolf's essay \"Middlebrow\" calls for cultural triage and asserts that modernists made literature difficult to make the common reader \"illiterate once again\" and to preserve \"a body of culture as the exclusive property of a coterie\" (394). He does caution, though, that \"no two individual reading histories [are] alike,\" that generalizations about readers, though not \"completely groundless,\" neglect the \"more complicated and ambiguous\" use of literacy, and that \"[t]he only workable method is to consult the readers themselves\" (367). Exactly. As Anna Snaith and Melba Cuddy-Keane discovered, one of the best ways to consult readers themselves is through their letters to Woolf. (2) Because, as Helen Waddell points out when she encloses someone else's letter about The Waves in her own note to Woolf, \"in spite of all that has already been said in print, there is something in the manuscript word and in the circumstances of the writing that makes it valuable\" (Letter 78). I discovered the same thing in the summer of 2001. At a session called \"Archives in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\" during the Eleventh Annual Conference on Virginia Woolf at the University of Bangor in Wales, Bet Inglis, the retired Assistant Librarian in the Manuscripts Section at the University of Sussex, talked about the treasures in the Monks House Papers and casually mentioned that someone should take a look at the correspondence between Virginia Woolf and Elizabeth Bowen housed there. When I got to the Sussex archives the next week, planning to spend the entire summer on the drafts of early reviews written by Virginia Stephen, I thought I might take an afternoon to follow up on her suggestion. That digression quickly became an obsession, an archive-junkie race through the correspondence to Virginia Woolf located in Letters III of the Monks House Papers (SxMs 18). But what intrigued me, what I became addicted to, were not the letters from Elizabeth Bowen, engaging as they are. No, although the known correspondents in the authornamed files in Letters III certainly claimed some of my attention, what I could not stop reading and transcribing that crazed summer were the letters in a box tantalizingly called Correspondence of Various Persons re: Books, Articles. (3) Woolf's readers came alive as I read their letters, and I could not turn my back on them. \"[G]iving a voice ... to the silent reader\" (Carr), this collection of letters grows out of and builds on the fine work of Snaith, Cuddy-Keane, and Oldfield, increases the number of actual (as opposed to imagined) readers Woolf scholars can consult, and moves Woolf studies, particularly studies of her reception, another step closer to a full record of letters written to Virginia Woolf about her work and thus to a more accurate view of the \"far wider circle\" Woolf hoped to reach (L6 420). \u2026\n\n==\n\nSquier 1983:\n\nTitle: \"The London Scene\": Gender and Class in Virginia Woolf's London\n\nAbstract: Whether she thought it \"the most beautiful place on the face of the earth\" or \"the very devil,\" to Virginia Woolf the city of London was the focus for an intense, often ambivalent, lifelong scrutiny. Not only did she make her home there for nearly all of her fifty-nine years-first in the narrow streets of Kensington and then in the spacious squares of Bloomsbury-but she found it a powerfully evocative figure in the literary tradition within which she wrote. And one of the most powerful nonfiction representations of Virginia Woolf's response to London was the series of six essays which appeared a little over fifty years ago, from December 1931 to December 1932, in the magazine Good Housekeeping. As their titles indicate, the essays surveyed the highs and lows of the city: \"The Docks of London,\" \"Oxford Street Tide,\" \"Great Men's Houses,\" \"Abbeys and Cathedrals,\" \" 'This is the House of Commons,'\" and \"Portrait of a Londoner.\" Plotless, descriptive, slight as these essays seemed at the time to Woolf, to readers of today the \"London Scene\" essays are fascinating, for as I will show, they reveal Virginia Woolf's ambivalence about identity, social position, and access to material possessions, and they contain the strategies forged to accommodate her changing sense of self and social place without alienating the Good Housekeeping audience. Although the \"London Scene\" essays celebrate a conventionally modernist setting, the city, they are anything but conventionally modernist in their approach. At their best they subvert the often complacent genre of the urban travelogue to portray gender and class relations in the modern city.1 Woolf struggled with conflicting identifications in the \"London Scene\" essays, between insiders (men, the upper classes) and outsiders (women, the working classes), and she used a number of different\n\n==\n\nChilders 2009:\n\nTitle: Virginia Woolf on the Outside Looking Down: Reflections on the Class of Women\n\nAbstract: Sur la contradiction politique/esthetique et les limites du feminisme woolfien.

Stephen Barkway\u2019s masterly, albeit brisk and businesslike, tour of Vita Sackville-West\u2019s 18-year association with the Press makes a similar point. While the best-selling novel The Edwardians (1930) earned much needed profits, signed limited editions of Sackville-West\u2019s poetry bolstered the firm\u2019s cultural capital. Barkway is a superb guide to the hard-boiled gentility that typified business dealings between Leonard and Sackville-West, severed shortly after Virginia\u2019s death by a poignant rejection letter. Southworth\u2019s contribution to the volume is strong but her characterizations of the \u201cworking-class voices\u201d (229) promoted by the Press prompts me to wonder how reliably she can parse British class distinctions. R. M. Fox, an Oxford educated son of a headmistress, was no more working class than George Orwell. Dealing with the Welsh poet Huw Menai, an ex-miner, Southworth provides a telling observation regarding the \u201cfaddishness of his London supporters, who dropped him when he failed to play up his colliery connections\u201d (224). The \u201cworking-class\u201d credentials paraded by the Hogarth Press were always tinged by an element of patrician patronage.4 It is laudable that these wide-ranging case studies should concentrate on the work of writers and artists who, for the most part, have rarely been examined in relation to the Hogarth Press. Southworth\u2019s intelligently edited collection successfully challenges and complicates received wisdom about the Woolfs as publishers. It also protests too much: Willis\u2019s detailed history of the Press remains indispensable.\n\n==\n\nCuddy\u2010Keane 2003:\n\nTitle: Virginia Woolf, the Intellectual, and the Public Sphere: Democratic highbrow: Woolf and the classless intellectual\n\nAbstract: \u201cWhen I use a word,\u201d Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, \u201cit means just what I choose it to mean \u2013 neither more nor less.\u201d \u201cThe question is,\u201d said Alice, \u201cwhether you can make words mean so many different things.\u201d \u201cThe question is,\u201d said Humpty Dumpty, \u201cwhich is to be master \u2013 that's all.\u201d Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland It is also that the variations and confusions of meaning are not just faults in a system, or errors of feedback, or deficiencies of education.

What can really be contributed is not resolution but perhaps, at times, just that extra edge of consciousness. Raymond Williams, Keywords CULTURAL KEYWORDS To write about Virginia Woolf as a democratic highbrow is to invoke controversy.

Fernald (2005) highlights Woolf's dual role as a woman and the daughter of a Victorian man-of-letters, which allowed her to enter public discourse \"by the side door.\" Daugherty (2006) further explores this by examining the diverse readership of Woolf's work, which extended beyond her own class.\n\nSquier (1983) discusses Woolf's ambivalence about identity, social position, and material possessions in her response to London.

Research indicates this can be a challenging part of their role. Little is known about graduating paramedic student confidence, concerns and learning in this area.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn online cross-sectional survey of students nearing completion of a paramedic degree in New Zealand, including piloting of a newly-developed confidence scale.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeventy-two participants reported varying exposure to termination of resuscitation and patient death. Participants felt most confident providing technical procedurally-based care and least confident with non-technical skills. Participants' greatest concerns included making 'the right call', supporting grieving family, controlling emotions and encountering conflict. Clinical exposure with supportive mentoring, clinical simulation, peer reflection and resolved personal experience with death, were considered most useful for professional development.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nExposure to termination of resuscitation and management of the scene of a patient death is variable amongst graduating paramedics. Novice paramedics may benefit from opportunities to observe and rehearse non-technical skills including delivering death notification and communicating with bystanders and bereaved family.

This is because of their role in ensuring patients\u2019 safety and quality-care provision. Aim This study investigated the paramedic students\u2019 satisfaction and self-confidence in the clinical simulation of an emergency medical care programme. Setting The study was conducted at the Durban University of Technology in the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa. The paramedic students\u2019 satisfaction and self-confidence in the clinical simulation of an emergency medical care programme were the focus of the study. Methods The study used a cross-sectional research design. A convenience sampling method was used to select the 83-paramedic students who participated in the study. Data were collected between July and September 2017 using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages and Spearman\u2019s rank-order correlation coefficient) and an inferential test, ordinal logistic regression analysis, were used for data analysis. Results High levels of paramedic students\u2019 satisfaction and self-confidence in simulation activities were reported. Generally, the paramedic students\u2019 demographics were associated with the satisfaction and self-confidence variables with p-values \u2264 0.04. Emergency medical care training undertaken by the paramedic students was significantly associated with self-confidence (p = 0.00).

It is a hands-on approach that promotes students learning of clinical skills through reflection.\n\n==\n\nHolmes 2017:\n\nTitle: Student Paramedic Anticipation, Confidence and Fears: Do Undergraduate Courses Prepare Student Paramedics for the Mental Health Challenges of the Profession?\n\nAbstract: Introduction This study explores the preparedness of undergraduate student paramedics for the mental health challenges of the paramedic profession from the perspective of course coordinators and their students. Methods Two surveys were developed and administered to course coordinators and students of the 16 undergraduate degree paramedicine courses across Australia and New Zealand. Sixteen course coordinators and 302 students responded. Results Results illustrate there was widespread recognition for the need to include preparation for the mental health challenges of the profession within undergraduate courses. Furthermore, most course coordinators and students had a preference for this topic to be taught using multiple teaching modes with particular preference for teaching the topic via discussion and activity based education. Teaching the topic as a standalone unit was supported by more than a third of course coordinators (43%) and a third of students (32%). Conclusion Six themes were identified as positive by anticipants: caring for people, high acuity work, diversity of work and patients, making a difference to patients and their families, using clinical skills and knowledge and engaging with the community. Students were most confident about communicating with patients and using clinical skills and knowledge. Students were least confident about clinical decision making and the most commonly cited fear was making a clinical mistake. A significant proportion of students (16%) feared for their personal mental wellbeing and 14% reported they were least confident about personal mental health within the profession.\n\n==\n\nRoss 2014:\n\nTitle: Perceptions of Student Paramedic Interpersonal Communication Competence: A Cross-Sectional Study\n\nAbstract: Introduction Interpersonal communication skills are essential to the healthcare practitioner aiding in high quality, effective and safe clinical practice. Effective communication exerts a positive influence on the patient's physical and emotional status resulting in better patient outcomes and satisfaction. By identifying strengths and weaknesses, self-assessment of interpersonal communication skills can be used as an intervention tool to inform future curriculum renewal. The objective of this study was to identify paramedic students\u2019 perceptions of their interpersonal communication competence. Methods Second year paramedic students from Monash University (Victoria) were invited to participate in a survey that asked them to record perceptions of their interpersonal communication skills using the Interpersonal Communication Competence Scale (ICCS). The ICCS is a 30-item unipolar questionnaire using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). Mean and standard deviations (SD) were used to report results. Results Fifty-six second year paramedic students participated in the study. Participants were predominantly aged less than 25 years (85.7%) and male n=36 (64.3%). Students reported \u2018often\u2019 or \u2018almost always\u2019 for the items: \u2018I put myself in others\u2019 shoes\u2019, n=46 (82%), mean=3.98 (SD 0.59); and, \u2018I let others know that I understand what they say\u2019, n=45 (80%), mean=3.96 (SD 0.66). Students reported \u2018sometimes\u2019, \u2018often\u2019 or \u2018almost always\u2019, for the items: \u2018I have trouble convincing others to do what I want them to do\u2019, n=55 (98%), mean=3.5 (SD 0.63); and, \u2018My mind wanders during conversations\u2019, n=41 (73%), mean=3.05 (SD 0.88). Conclusion Preliminary results suggest that student paramedics self-report their interpersonal communication skills highly apart from areas related to assertiveness and listening skills. These results could be indicative of student age, personality or experience level and warrant further research with larger sample sizes.\n\n==\n\nWilliams 2015:\n\nTitle: Are paramedic students ready to be professional?

Coupled with the movements towards national registration in Australia and New Zealand, these advancements contribute to the paramedic discipline gaining recognition as a health profession.\n\n\nAIM\nThe aim of this paper was to explore paramedic students' views on paramedic professionalism in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing a convenience sample of paramedic students from Whitireia New Zealand, Charles Sturt University and Monash University, attitudes towards paramedic professionalism were measured using the Professionalism at Work Questionnaire. The 77 item questionnaire uses a combination of binary and unipolar Likert scales (1\u2009=\u2009Strongly disagree/5\u2009=\u2009Strongly agree; Never\u2009=\u20091/Always\u2009=\u20095).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 479 students who participated in the study from Charles Sturt University n\u2009=\u2009272 (56.8%), Monash University n\u2009=\u2009145 (30.3%) and Whitireia New Zealand n\u2009=\u200962 (12.9%). A number of items produced statistically significant differences P\u2009<\u20090.05 between universities, year levels and course type. These included: 'Allow my liking or dislike for patients to affect the way I approach them' and 'Discuss a bad job with family or friends outside work as a way of coping'.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results suggest that paramedic students are strong advocates of paramedic professionalism and support the need for regulation. Data also suggest that the next generation of paramedics can be the agents of change for the paramedic discipline as it attempts to achieve full professional status.\n\n==\n\nBoyle 2008:\n\nTitle: Ambulance clinical placements \u2013 A pilot study of students' experience\n\nAbstract: BackgroundUndergraduate paramedic students undertake clinical placements in a variety of locations. These placements are considered an essential element for paramedic pre-employment education. However, anecdotal evidence suggests some students have not had positive experiences on their emergency ambulance placements. The objective of this study was to identify the type of experiences had by students during ambulance clinical placements and to provide feedback to the ambulance services.MethodsIn this pilot study we employed a cross-sectional study methodology, using a convenience sample of undergraduate paramedic students available in semester one of 2007 to ascertain the students' views on their reception by on-road paramedics and their overall experience on emergency ambulance clinical placements. Ethics approval was granted.ResultsThere were 77 students who participated in the survey, 64% were females, with 92% of students < 25 years of age and 55% < 65 Kg in weight. There was a statistically significant difference in average height between the genders (Male 179 cm vs Female 168 cm, p < 0.001). Clinical instructors were available to 44% of students with 30% of students excluded from patient management. Thirty percent of students felt there was a lot of unproductive down time during the placement. Paramedics remarked to 40% of students that they doubted their ability to perform the physical role of a paramedic, of this group 36% were advised this more than once.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that for a small group of students, emergency ambulance clinical placements were not a positive experience clinically or educationally. Some qualified paramedics doubt if a number of female students can perform the physical role of a paramedic.\n\n==\n\nJensen 2016:\n\nTitle: A Survey to Determine Decision-Making Styles of Working Paramedics and Student Paramedics.\n\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nTwo major processes underlie human decision-making: experiential (intuitive) and rational (conscious) thinking. The predominant thinking process used by working paramedics and student paramedics to make clinical decisions is unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA survey was administered to ground ambulance paramedics and to primary care paramedic students. The survey included demographic questions and the Rational Experiential Inventory-40, a validated psychometric tool involving 40 questions. Twenty questions evaluated each thinking style: 10 assessed preference and 10 assessed ability to use that style. Responses were provided on a five-point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating higher affinity for the style in question. Analysis included both descriptive statistics and t tests to evaluate differences in thinking style.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe response rate was 88.4% (1172/1326). Paramedics (n=904) had a median age of 36 years (IQR 29-42) and most were male (69.5%) and primary or advanced care paramedics (PCP=55.5%; ACP=32.5%). Paramedic students (n=268) had a median age of 23 years (IQR 21-26), most were male (63.1%) and had completed high school (31.7%) or an undergraduate degree (25.4%) prior to paramedic training. Both groups scored their ability to use and favourability toward rational thinking significantly higher than experiential thinking. The mean score for rational thinking was 3.86/5 among paramedics and 3.97/5 among paramedic students (p<0.001). The mean score for experiential thinking was 3.41/5 among paramedics and 3.35/5 among paramedic students (p=0.06).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWorking paramedics and student paramedics prefer and perceive that they have the ability to use rational over experiential thinking. This information adds to our current knowledge on paramedic decision-making and is potentially important for developing continuing education and clinical support tools.\n\n==\n\nLowery 2005:\n\nTitle: Role of peer support and emotional expression on posttraumatic stress disorder in student paramedics.\n\nAbstract: This exploratory study contrasted and tested the predictive value of the reverse buffering hypothesis of social support and the information processing model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in an investigation of trauma-related symptomatology (TRS) in a single sample of 42 student paramedics. Participants completed several anonymous self-report measures of PTSD symptomatology, peer social support, and attitude toward emotional expression. Regression-based path analyses did not support either theory of PTSD in this population. A path model of PTSD in student paramedics was subsequently developed, indicating that a direct relationship exists between duty-related trauma exposure, dysfunctional peer social support, and students' negative attitudes toward emotional expression. This new model accounted for 30% of the variance in student paramedics' TRS.", "final_summary": "The confidence of student paramedics when performing a lifting assessment is a multifaceted issue, with various studies exploring different aspects of this topic. \n\nAnderson (2019) found that paramedic students felt most confident providing technical procedurally-based care, but less confident with non-technical skills. This suggests that while students may feel confident in their ability to perform a lifting assessment, they may lack confidence in the interpersonal and decision-making aspects of the task. \n\nSandy (2021) reported high levels of student satisfaction and self-confidence in clinical simulation activities, indicating that simulated practice could enhance confidence in tasks such as lifting assessments. \n\nHolmes (2017) found that students were most confident about communicating with patients and using clinical skills, but least confident about clinical decision making. This could imply that while students may feel confident in the physical act of performing a lifting assessment, they may lack confidence in their ability to make decisions based on the assessment. \n\nRoss (2014) found that student paramedics self-reported high interpersonal communication skills, apart from areas related to assertiveness and listening skills. This could impact their confidence when communicating the results of a lifting assessment to patients or colleagues. \n\nWilliams (2015) found that paramedic students strongly advocated for professionalism, suggesting that they understand the importance of performing tasks such as lifting assessments professionally and competently. \n\nBoyle (2008) found that some students had negative experiences on emergency ambulance placements, with some qualified paramedics doubting their ability to perform the physical role of a paramedic. This could potentially impact student confidence in performing physically demanding tasks such as lifting assessments. \n\nJensen (2016) found that both working paramedics and student paramedics prefer and perceive that they have the ability to use rational over experiential thinking. This could influence their confidence in making decisions based on lifting assessments. \n\nFinally, Lowery (2005) found a direct relationship between trauma exposure, dysfunctional peer social support, and students' negative attitudes toward emotional expression. This suggests that the emotional and social aspects of the job could impact student confidence in various tasks, including lifting assessments. \n\nIn conclusion, while student paramedics may feel confident in the technical aspects of performing a lifting assessment, they may lack confidence in the decision-making and interpersonal aspects of the task. Factors such as negative placement experiences, lack of assertiveness, and emotional challenges could also impact their confidence. Further research is needed to explore these issues in more depth and develop strategies to enhance student confidence."}, {"query": "tay-sachs and sulfated glycolipid", "paper_list_string": "Hoffman 1977:\n\nTitle: GLYCOSPHINGOLIPIDS IN FETAL TAY\u2010SACHS DISEASE BRAIN AND LUNG CULTURES\n\nAbstract: Abstract\u2014 A study was undertaken of the glycosphingolipids in cell cultures derived from cerebellum of Tay\u2010Sachs disease fetal brain in order to determine the suitability of such cell strains as a model for Tay\u2010Sachs disease. The glycosphingolipids in the Tay\u2010Sachs disease cultured cerebellar cells were compared with those found in normal cultured cerebellar cells, normal and Tay\u2010Sachs cultured lung cells, and normal and Tay\u2010Sachs fetal brain. The glycolipids were separated by TLC, then analyzed by GLC of the trimethylsilyi derivatives of the methylglycosides of the sugar moieties. In the cultured cerebellar lines, the predominant gangliosides were GM2, GM3, and GD3. There was a 4\u2010fold increase of GM2 in the Tay\u2010Sachs as compared with the normal line. Only GM3 and GD3 gangliosides were found in the Tay\u2010Sachs and the normal fetal lung cell cultures. The major neutral glycosphingolipids in all of the cultured cells which were analyzed were glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, digalactosyl\u2010glucosylceramide, and globoside. When the Tay\u2010Sachs cerebellar cells were labelled with [1\u201014C]gluco\u2010samine, some radioactivity was observed in the trihexosylceramide band, indicating the presence of a small amount of a galactosamine\u2010containing trihexosylceramide which may be asialo\u2010GM2 (GA2). The trihexosylceramide in Tay\u2010Sachs fetal brain was identified as GA2 by GLC. Both Tay\u2010Sachs and normal fetal brain gangliosides were more complex than those found in the cultured cells. Long chain fatty acids (C24:0 and C24;1) predominated in all of the glycosphingolipids of the Tay\u2010Sachs and the normal cultured cerebellar cells. In contrast, the glycosphingolipids of Tay\u2010Sachs and normal fetal brain contained mainly the shorter chain fatty acids (C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1). The cerebrosides in both the Tay\u2010Sachs and normal fetal brains were mainly glucosylceramide with only small amounts of the galactosylceramide which predominates in infant brain.

Although lipids of this composition have not been identified with certainty in brain tissue, there is nevertheless some indication that they might be present in small amounts (WEISS, 1956; KLENK et al., 1957; SVENNERHOLM and RAAL, 1961). Two such glycolipids have now been isolated from brain tissue of patients with Infantile Amaurotic Familial Idiocy (Tay-Sach's disease). The main biochemical abnormality which characterizes this disease is an accumulation of gangliosides (KLENK, 1939); the two new compounds which have now been identified in brain tissue of Tay-Sachs' disease belong to the same class of lipids. The isolation and chemical composition of these two glycolipids are described in the present communication. Some of this work has appeared in preliminary reports (GATT and BERMAN, 1961 ; BERMAN and GATT, 1962).\n\n==\n\nToma 2005:\n\nTitle: Impaired sulphated glycosaminoglycan metabolism in a patient with GM-2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease)\n\nAbstract: SummaryAn abnormal urinary excretion of sulphated glycosaminoglycans in a patient with GM-2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease) is described. Besides the accumulation of GM-2 ganglioside in liver and lack of hexosaminidase A, the patient shows an abnormal urinary excretion of an iduronic acid-rich low molecular weight heparan sulphate. Also, no dermatan sulphate could be detected in the urine, whereas this compound was the main sulphated glycosaminoglycan in the liver of the patient. Heparan sulphate was the main glycosaminoglycan of normal liver. The total amount of sulphated glycosaminoglycans in the urine and liver of the patient did not differ significantly from the amounts found in the liver and urine of normal subjects. Several plasma glycosidases have been assayed and the activities did not differ significantly from the values obtained for the plasma of normal subjects.\n\n==\n\nSandhoff 1969:\n\nTitle: Variation of \u03b2\u2010N\u2010acetylhexosaminidase\u2010pattern in Tay\u2010Sachs disease\n\nAbstract: Tay-Sachs disease is characterized by an accumulation of two types of glycosphingolipids, on the one hand ganglioside GM? (GalNAc-&1,4-(NeuNAc-&2,3) -Gal+1,4-Glc_13-1,1{2-N-acyl) sphingosine), and on the other its asialo residue (GalNAc-/3-1,4-Gal_P1,4GlcQ1,1(2-N-acyl)sphingosine) in nerve tissue [ l-31 . The disease is assumed to involve a lack of the enzyme which catabolizes the stored substances, similar to that present in other sphingolipidoses [4,5]. In a special case of Tay-Sachs disease with visceral storage of kidney globoside (GalNAc-P_1,3-Gal-/3-1,4-Gal-&l,4 GlcQ-1 ,l (2-N-acyl)sphingosine) a general lack of /3-Nacetylhexosaminidase activity was found [6] (fig. Id). The stored glycosphingolipids (ganglioside GM, and its asialo residue in nerve tissue, and kidney globoside in the visceral organs) in this case had in common a terminal /3-glycosidic-bound N-acetylgalactosamine, being partially hydrolized by PN-acetylhexosaminidase-preparations [6,7]. The same substances also accumulate in the various tissues of conventional Tay-Sachs cases, although the storage level of the asialo residue of ganglioside GM, and of the kidney globoside is found to be lower [6]. Accordingly, the lack of some particular /3-N-acetylhexosaminidase was discussed as one of the possible causes for storage in cases of conventional Tay-Sachs disease [6]. In the present study the f3-N-acetylhexosaminidase pattern of 4 cases of conventional Tay-Sachs disease is des cribed. In three of the four cases a lack of the PN-ace-\n\n==\n\nHoffman 1978:\n\nTitle: Fetal tay-sachs disease brain cells in culture: lack of turnover in [14C]glucosamine-labeled GM2\n\n\nAbstract: Abstract The glycosphingolipids in a cultured cell strain derived from Tay-Sachs disease fetal cerebellum were pulse-labeled with radioactive [ 14 C]glucosamine. The turnover of individual gangliosides in the cells were followed during a 10 day period. All of the gangliosides except G M2 had a buildup of counts which peaked between 24 and 96 h, then decreased. In contrast, the counts incorporated into G M2 did not decrease during the entire course of the experiment. The lack of turnover in G M2 ganglioside provides support for the use of these cultured brain cells as a model for Tay-Sachs disease.\n\n==\n\nYu 1983:\n\nTitle: Characterization of some minor gangliosides in Tay\u2014Sachs brains\n\nAbstract: Abstract The ganglioside distribution of Tay\u2014Sachs brain was re-examined in detail. In both the gray and white matter, the levels of lipid-bound sialic acid were increased 6- and 10-fold, respectively, over normal infant brain, and approximately 90% of the total ganglioside was G M2 . The level of G M2 was increased about 90 times in gray matter and 220 times in white matter in comparison with that in normal controls. The level of G D1a -GaINAc was increased 19 times and 10 times in gray and white matter, respectively. The concentration of G D2 was increased about 4-fold in Tay-S-Sachs white matter. In addition, the G M3 level was increased 2.7 and 3.5 times and the G D3 level 2 and 2.4 times over normal gray and white matter, respectively. However, the levels of other complex gangliosides such as G M1 , G D1a , G D1b , G T1b and G Q1b decreased remarkably. Since G M2 , G D2 , G D1a -GalNAc and a recently characterized ganglioside G M1b -GalNAc possess a common N-acetylgalactosaminyl terminal structure, their accumulation in Tay\u2014Sachs brains is therefore consistent with the known hexosaminidase A deficiency. However, the accumulation of hexosamine-free G M3 and G D3 is not. The in vitro incorporation of N-acetylgalactosamine into G M3 to form G M2 was examined in a rat brain microsomal fraction in the presence of large amounts of other glycolipids. Acidic glycolipids were slightly stimulating and then became increasingly inhibitory when the molar ratio of lipid to substrate G M3 exceeded 10 to 1. Neutral glycolipids and the phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, were inhibitory at all levels tested. The data suggest that the accumulation of G M3 and G D3 in Tay\u2014Sachs brains could be due to an inhibition of N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferas by high levels of glycolipids, and the inhibition is not due to chelation of the obligate divalent cation necessary for the activity of this enzyme. The inhibition of this enzyme may also be responsible for the decreased levels of other complex gangliosides.\n\n==\n\nPlatt 1997:\n\nTitle: Prevention of lysosomal storage in Tay-Sachs mice treated with N-butyldeoxynojirimycin.\n\nAbstract: The glycosphingolipid (GSL) lysosomal storage diseases result from the inheritance of defects in the genes encoding the enzymes required for catabolism of GSLs within lysosomes. A strategy for the treatment of these diseases, based on an inhibitor of GSL biosynthesis N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, was evaluated in a mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease. When Tay-Sachs mice were treated with N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, the accumulation of GM2 in the brain was prevented, with the number of storage neurons and the quantity of ganglioside stored per cell markedly reduced. Thus, limiting the biosynthesis of the substrate (GM2) for the defective enzyme (beta-hexosaminidase A) prevents GSL accumulation and the neuropathology associated with its lysosomal storage.\n\n==\n\nSchneck 1976:\n\nTitle: Glycolipids in cultured fetal Tay-Sachs disease cerebellar cells.\n\nAbstract: Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a fatal, genetically determined disorder of sphingoglycolipid metabolism, associated with the absence of the lysosomal enzyme B-D-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (Hex A) (1). There is a massive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, and its asialo derivative GA2 in cells of the central nervous system. A cell culture which reproduces these biochemical parameters would permit one to measure the effect of enzyme replacement therapy under controlled conditions that are not easily attainable in vivo. Although skin fibroblasts cultured from TSD patients lack Hex A, these cultured cells do not accumulate GM2 ganglioside (2). Since TSD is a neuronal lipid storage disease, and since fetal TSD brain has the characteristic glycolipid patterns found in infant TSD brain, a cell strain from fetal TSD cerebellum was established and the glycolipid patterns were evaluated by TLC and GLC (3). The cells were labelled with 14C-glucosamine in order to compare the metabolic activity of the gangliosides over an extended time period. The cells were also transformed with the oncogenic DNA SV-40 virus (4) since we wished to establish a permanent cell line for the study of this disease.", "final_summary": "The research question \"Tay-Sachs and sulfated glycolipid\" delves into the intricate relationship between the genetic disorder Tay-Sachs and the metabolism of sulfated glycolipids. \n\nTay-Sachs disease is characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme \u03b2-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (Sandhoff, 1969). This deficiency leads to a significant accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in the brain, as observed in studies by Hoffman (1977) and Yu (1983). Specifically, Hoffman (1977) found a four-fold increase of GM2 in Tay-Sachs disease cultured cerebellar cells compared to normal cells, while Yu (1983) noted a 90 to 220-fold increase in GM2 levels in different areas of Tay-Sachs brains compared to normal controls.\n\nIn addition to the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides, Toma (2005) reported an abnormal urinary excretion of sulphated glycosaminoglycans in a patient with Tay-Sachs disease. This suggests a potential impairment in the metabolism of these compounds in individuals with Tay-Sachs disease. This metabolic impairment is further supported by Hoffman's (1978) observation of a lack of turnover in GM2 gangliosides in Tay-Sachs disease cells.\n\nPlatt (1997) proposed a potential strategy to address this metabolic impairment. By limiting the biosynthesis of GM2 using an inhibitor, the accumulation of GM2 and the associated neuropathology were prevented in a mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nIn conclusion, the papers collectively suggest that Tay-Sachs disease, characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme \u03b2-N-acetylhexosaminidase A, leads to an accumulation of GM2 gangliosides and potentially impaired metabolism of sulfated glycolipids. This metabolic impairment, specifically the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides, may be a potential target for treatment strategies in Tay-Sachs disease (Platt, 1997). Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying this impairment and to develop effective treatments for Tay-Sachs disease."}, {"query": "\u201cscreen addiction in middle or high school students\u201d", "paper_list_string": "Garc\u00eda-Santill\u00e1n 2021:\n\nTitle: Addiction to the Smartphone in High School Students: How It\u2019s in Daily Life?\n\nAbstract: Nowadays, the serious situation that affects the entire world goes beyond the social, cultural, economic problems and other conflicts that occur day by day. These were left aside to move to a global alert; we refer to the pandemic crisis that all the nations of the world are facing. Confinement forced people all over the world to stay at home; therefore, communications through electronic devices became very necessary. This study does not seek to analyze the pandemic crisis; its purpose is to analyze the use that students give to their mobile phone, to determine if this has generated addiction, in addition to identifying if use differs in men and in women. Participants were 184 high school students enrolled in a public sector institution in the Port of Veracruz, Mexico. To obtain the data, the SAS-CV test was used. This contains questions related to the profile of the respondent and 10 items in Likert format. It was distributed via electronic devices for their response.

A Cross-Sectional Study in South Karnataka\n\nAbstract: Background: Media, including mobile phones, computers, and social media, is a dominant force in the lives of adolescents, and has now penetrated the rural areas. Screen addiction (SA) is a pathological compulsive use of screen-based devices. Objectives: To estimate SA and its associated factors among school-going adolescents residing in a rural area in South Karnataka. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescents (10-19 years) in 4 schools of Solur Hobli, Ramanagara district, using a structured questionnaire including physical activity, family, and academic stressors. SA was assessed using Tao\u2019s Diagnostic Criteria for Internet Addiction. Depression was screened using Physical Health Questionnaire-9. Chi-square test and logistic regression were done for factors associated with SA. Results: Of the 335 adolescents, 20% felt preoccupied with screens, 8% felt restless, moody, and irritable when not using them, 26% used screen devices as a way of escaping problems or relieving irritable mood, 12% had depression, and 3.9% had SA. SA was significantly higher among depressed subjects (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.18 [1.48-18.13], P = .010), males (AOR = 12.54 [1.46-109.9], P = .021), adolescents who felt that their parents fought frequently (AOR = 4.21 (1.17-15.09), P = 0.027), and adolescents who did not participate in sports (AOR = 3.82 (confidence interval: 1.04-14.06], P = 0.044). Conclusion: While proportion of rural students with SA is still low, we need to prevent this from developing into a public health issue by recognizing SA and depression among students and develop targeted interventions to manage the same, including increasing awareness among teachers and students about SA and its link with depression.\n\n==\n\nChoi 2021:\n\nTitle: Association Between Screen Overuse and Behavioral and Emotional Problems in Elementary School Children\n\nAbstract: Objectives This study identified the association between excessive exposure to screen media and behavioral and emotional problems in elementary school students.

The study sample consisted of students attending high school in the central district of Mersin. The data were summarized by descriptive statistics and compared by a binary logistic regression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur study population included 1156 students, among whom 609 (52.7%) were male. The mean age of the students was 16.1 \u00b1 0.9 years. Seventy-nine percent of the students had a computer at home, and 64.0% had a home Internet connection. In this study, 175 (15.1%) students were defined as Internet addicts. Whereas the addiction rate was 9.3% in girls, it was 20.4% in boys (P < 0.001). In this study, Internet addiction was found to have an independent relationship with gender, grade level, having a hobby, duration of daily computer use, depression and negative self-perception.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAccording to our study results, the prevalence of Internet addiction was high among high school students. We recommend preventing Internet addiction among adolescents by building a healthy living environment around them, controlling the computer and Internet use, promoting book reading and providing treatment to those with a psychological problem.\n\n==\n\nAhmadi 2014:\n\nTitle: Prevalence of Addiction to the Internet, Computer Games, DVD, and Video and Its Relationship to Anxiety and Depression in a Sample of Iranian High School Students\n\nAbstract: Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of addiction to the Internet, computer games, DVD, and video and its relationship to anxiety and depression in a sample of Iranian high school students. Methods: In this cross-sectional study 1020 high school students (males and females) were selected randomly from different areas of Shiraz city in southern Iran. They were interviewed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed (DSM-IV) criteria. Results: About 50% of the students were females, 277 students (27.2%) were studying in the first year of high school, 242 (23.7%) were in the second year, and others in the third year. The prevalence of anxiety was significantly higher in females than in males (p < 0.05). The prevalence of anxiety was lower among students of the third year (p < 0.05). The prevalence of depression was significantly higher in students with lower economic status defined as family monthly income. Internet dependence was seen only in 5 students. The prevalence of anxiety was significantly higher in the students who used internet for chatting, amusement, and reading news (p < 0.05). The prevalence of anxiety was significantly higher in students who were DVD or video CD dependents (p < 0.05). The students who used especial drugs or had especial diseases had higher rates of depression and anxiety (p < 0.05).

Researchers in China, Taiwan and Korea have done extensive research in the field of Internet addiction. Screening instruments are available to identify the presence of Internet addiction and its extent. Internet addiction is frequently associated with mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Treatment modalities include individual and group therapies, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), family therapy and psychotropic medications. A significant proportion of Singapore adolescents engaging in excessive Internet use are also diagnosed to have concomitant Internet addiction. Despite the presence of a variety of treatment options, future research in this area is needed to address its growing trend and to minimise its negative psychological and social impact on the individuals and their families.\n\n==\n\nLi 2022:\n\nTitle: Association of Parental Screen Addiction with Young Children\u2019s Screen Addiction: A Chain-Mediating Model\n\nAbstract: Preschool children are immersed in screen media, yet little study has been conducted on screen addiction among them. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between parental screen addiction and young children\u2019s screen addiction and to verify factors that mediate this relationship. A total of 477 parents of kindergarteners (3\u20136 years old) were recruited via six kindergartens in Henan province, China. They completed the Problematic Media Use Measure Short Form of Children, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the Child\u2013Parent Relationship Scale, and the Parental Screen Addiction Scale. The results showed that the relationships between each pair of parental screen addiction, parental anxiety, and children\u2019s screen addiction were significantly positive, but the parent\u2013child relationship was negatively correlated with the other variables. Parental screen addiction can directly and indirectly affect children\u2019s screen addiction through parental anxiety and the parent\u2013child relationship. The findings contribute to the development of family protection mechanisms against screen addiction in children.", "final_summary": "Screen addiction, a pathological compulsive use of screen-based devices, is a growing concern among middle and high school students.

Scientists' and teachers' perceptions of science education\n\nAbstract: Although there have been numerous studies that indicate the benefits of teachers and students working with scientists, there is little research that documents scientists' views of science education, science teacher preparation, and the goals of science education. Furthermore, little is known about how scientists' views of science education may differ from those held by science teachers. Through the use of semistructured interviews, the perceptions of 37 scientists from diverse science domains and 21 middle and high school science teachers were explored. Participating scientists expressed concerns about the variability in quality of teaching, programs, and resources available for science instruction. Scientists expressed a desire for teachers to have more experience conducting science research and developing their own critical thinking skills. When asked what goals are most important for science education, 40% of the scientists emphasized that teachers should make science fun and exciting for their students. Science teachers' perceptions of science education were compared with the scientists' perceptions. Thirty percent of the teachers agreed with the scientists that too much variability in program or instructional quality exists in science education. Seventy-six percent of the science teachers also thought there is a need to teach critical thinking skills, but more importantly there is a need to inspire creativity and a desire to learn science in students. Both teachers and scientists expressed concerns about how high-stakes accountability inhibits efforts to improve science education. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This literature, which is increasingly informing how and in which contexts professional developers design and implement programs, states that scientists' divergent research interests and knowledge about K-12 science teachers often limit their involvement in these programs. Conversely, concerns persist that there is very little empirical evidence to support these programmatic recommendations made by the science education literature. This embedded case study was bounded by the contextual similarities between seven professional development workshops with the goal of examining the relationship between scientists' views of teachers as professionals and the pedagogical orientations that the scientists used within these professional development contexts. Multiple methods were employed including systematic classroom observation by nine trained observers, as well as analysis of course materials, interviews, and questionnaires. Altogether, the teacher comments and observation data paint a picture of how the instructors implemented specific pedagogical orientations. Participants appear to have realistic views about the practical roles that research scientists can play in professional development. We explore how these findings merit attention and suggest alternatives to current practice and policy. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Teacher education programs play an important role in the development of beliefs regarding teaching and learning. The purpose of the study was to document pre-service teachers\u2019 views on science, scientists, and science teaching as well as the relations between these views and the offered courses over several years spent in an elementary science teacher training program. The sample consisted of 145 pre-service elementary science teachers who were being trained to teach general science to students in the 6th through 8th grades. The research design was a cross-sectional study. Three different instruments were used to collect the data, namely, the \u201cDraw a Scientist Test\u201d, \u201cDraw a Science Teacher Test\u201d, and \u201cStudents\u2019 Views about Science\u201d tests. The elementary science teacher training program influenced pre-service science teachers\u2019 views about science, scientists and science teaching to different degrees. The most pronounced impact of the program was on views about science teaching. Participants\u2019 impressions of science teaching changed from teacher-centered views to student-centered ones. In contrast, participants\u2019 views about scientists and science did not change much. This result could be interpreted as indicating that science teacher training programs do not change views about science and scientists but do change beliefs regarding teaching science.\n\n==\n\nHouseal 2014:\n\nTitle: Impact of a Student-Teacher-Scientist Partnership on Students' and Teachers' Content Knowledge, Attitudes toward Science, and Pedagogical Practices.\n\nAbstract: Engaging K-12 students in science-based inquiry is at the center of current science education reform efforts. Inquiry can best be taught through experiential, authentic science experiences, such as those provided by Student\u2013Teacher\u2013Scientist Partnerships (STSPs). However, very little is known about the impact of STSPs on teachers' and students' content knowledge growth or changes in their attitudes about science and scientists. This study addressed these two areas by examining an STSP called \u201cStudents, Teachers, and Rangers and Research Scientists\u201d (STaRRS). STaRRS was incorporated into the existing long-standing education program \u201cExpedition: Yellowstone!\u201d For teachers, a pre-test, intervention, post-test research design was used to assess changes and gains in content knowledge, attitudes, and pedagogical practices. A quasi-experimental, pre-test\u2013post-test, comparison group design was used to gauge gains in students' content knowledge and attitudes. Data analyses showed significant positive shifts in teachers' attitudes regarding science and scientists, and shifts in their pedagogical choices. Students showed significant content knowledge gains and increased positive attitudes regarding their perceptions of scientists. The findings indicate that STSPs might serve as a promising context for providing teachers and students with the sort of experiences that enhance their understandings of and about scientific inquiry, and improve their attitudes toward science and scientists. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The study was conducted among experienced science teachers in Portugal who were \nfollowing advanced professional training programmes, usually leading to Masters' degrees in science \neducation. The results indicate that science teachers' knowledge of education research findings is \ngenerally very limited. What teachers regard as sound pedagogical knowledge is usually derived from \npersonal experience and 'common sense' and does tend not to be questioned by them as to its \ncompatibility with the results of research. The outcome of the study provides evidence of the \nexistence of a serious gap between research and the practice of science education. In the light of \nthese findings, the authors propose that to narrow this gap should be a major task to be addressed by \nresearchers and practitioners.\n\n==\n\nPilo 2012:\n\nTitle: Science Education and Teachers' Training: Research in Partnership.\n\nAbstract: International researches put to evidence a worrying decrease in science disciplines\u2019 roll in many countries, especially in European Community and a poor quality in scientific competences, as issues of TIMMS (trends in international mathematics and science study) and PISA (programme for international student assessment) have proved, together with a low interest concerning science knowledge of young people. According to our experience, the most important school-related factor in raising student achievement is the quality of the teacher. We investigated Italian pre-service teachers\u2019 scientific competences and their mind conceptions about teaching models/styles, students\u2019 learning, role of teacher and role of science in daily life. The aim of our research outlined in the present paper is to: (1) improve motivation, learning and pupils\u2019 attitudes in science education; (2) develop a critical thinking, stimulate intuition and creativity; and (3) increase scientific literacy in the community. We designed flexible materials, paths and courses within cooperation involving different institutions. The findings of this work concerning both pre-service and in-service teachers\u2019 training are: increased awareness about conceptual knots related to scientific concepts; more sensitiveness and attention to students\u2019 involvement; reflection about the effectiveness of daily school work-increased awareness about meta-cognition and cooperative learning.\n\n==\n\nLederman 1999:\n\nTitle: Teachers' Understanding of the Nature of Science and Classroom Practice: Factors That Facilitate or Impede the Relationship.\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this multiple case study was to investigate the relationship of teachers' understanding of the nature of science and classroom practice and to delineate factors that facilitate or impede a relationship. Five high school biology teachers, ranging in experience from 2 to 15 years, comprised the sample for this investigation. During one full academic year, multiple data sources were collected and included classroom observations, open-ended questionnaires, semistructured and structured interviews, and instructional plans and materials. In addition, students in each of the teachers' classrooms were interviewed with respect to their understanding of the nature of science. Using analytical induction, multiple data sources were analyzed independently and together to triangulate data while constructing teacher profiles. The results indicated that teachers' conceptions of science do not necessarily influence classroom practice. Of critical importance were teachers' level of experience, intentions, and perceptions of students. The results have importnat implications for teacher education as well as the successful implementation of current reforms. \u00a9 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

With a lack of scientific literacy for all students and insufficient numbers of individuals choosing to pursue careers in science, the situation is seen as a threat to the sustainability of a robust national economy. Continuing professional development for science teachers is considered a key reform strategy for addressing the problem. As nations invest considerable funds towards improving the quality of science teachers (and consequently student learning) it is reasonable to explore science teacher perceptions regarding the most effective professional learning opportunities. This descriptive study surveyed 118 candidates for National Board certification in Adolescent and Young Adult Science from 42 states about their professional learning experiences. The survey intended to answer the question: \u2018How do candidates perceive the relative effectiveness of different professional learning experiences?\u2019 \u2018Effectiveness\u2019 here is defined as a professional development's ability to help a teacher foster improved student learning. It is important to note that the survey focused on the approaches to professional development rather than the content or goals of said experiences. Candidates' self\u2010reports reveal that developing science curriculum, reading scientific literature, and pursuing National Board certification are the three most productive approaches to professional development while education courses and in\u2010service workshops were identified as least effective. The results suggest that no one model of professional development explains the top rated activities.", "final_summary": "The understanding of effective teaching, science education, and education improvement varies significantly between teachers and scientists, as evidenced by the research papers. \n\nTaylor (2008) found that scientists expressed concerns about the variability in quality of teaching and desired for teachers to have more experience conducting science research.

However, for many low-resource languages, the availability of a reliable translation service entails significant amounts of costly human-annotated translation pairs. Further, translation services may continue to be brittle due to domain mismatch between task-specific input text and general-purpose text used for training translation models. For multilingual semantic parsing, we demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility offered by large language models (LLMs) for translating English datasets into several languages via few-shot prompting. Through extensive comparisons on two public datasets, MTOP and MASSIVE, spanning 50 languages and several domains, we show that our method of translating data using LLMs outperforms a strong translate-train baseline on 41 out of 50 languages. We study the key design choices that enable more effective multilingual data translation via prompted LLMs.\n\n==\n\nBellegarda 2000:\n\nTitle: Large vocabulary speech recognition with multispan statistical language models\n\nAbstract: Multispan language modeling refers to the integration of various constraints, both local and global, present in the language. It was recently proposed to capture global constraints through the use of latent semantic analysis, while taking local constraints into account via the usual n-gram approach. This has led to several families of data-driven, multispan language models for large vocabulary speech recognition. Because of the inherent complementarity in the two types of constraints, the multispan performance, as measured by perplexity, has been shown to compare favorably with the corresponding n-gram performance. The objective of this work is to characterize the behavior of such multispan modeling in actual recognition. Major implementation issues are addressed, including search integration and context scope selection. Experiments are conducted on a subset of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) speaker-independent, 20000-word vocabulary, continuous speech task. Results show that, compared to standard n-gram, the multispan framework can lead to a reduction in average word error rate of over 20%. The paper concludes with a discussion of intrinsic multi-span tradeoffs, such as the influence of training data selection on the resulting performance.\n\n==\n\nZiems 2023:\n\nTitle: Large Language Models are Built-in Autoregressive Search Engines\n\nAbstract: Document retrieval is a key stage of standard Web search engines. Existing dual-encoder dense retrievers obtain representations for questions and documents independently, allowing for only shallow interactions between them. To overcome this limitation, recent autoregressive search engines replace the dual-encoder architecture by directly generating identifiers for relevant documents in the candidate pool. However, the training cost of such autoregressive search engines rises sharply as the number of candidate documents increases. In this paper, we find that large language models (LLMs) can follow human instructions to directly generate URLs for document retrieval. Surprisingly, when providing a few {Query-URL} pairs as in-context demonstrations, LLMs can generate Web URLs where nearly 90\\% of the corresponding documents contain correct answers to open-domain questions. In this way, LLMs can be thought of as built-in search engines, since they have not been explicitly trained to map questions to document identifiers. Experiments demonstrate that our method can consistently achieve better retrieval performance than existing retrieval approaches by a significant margin on three open-domain question answering benchmarks, under both zero and few-shot settings.

The search engines that perform the information retrieval tasks, often retrieve thousands of potentially interesting documents to a query. The documents should be ranked in decreasing order of relevance in order to be useful to the user. This book describes a mathematical model of information retrieval based on the use of statistical language models. The approach uses simple document-based unigram models to compute for each document the probability that it generates the query. This probability is used to rank the documents. The study makes the following research contributions. \n \n * The development of a model that integrates term weighting, relevance feedback and structured queries. \n * The development of a model that supports multiple representations of a request or information need by integrating a statistical translation model. \n * The development of a model that supports multiple representations of a document, for instance by allowing proximity searches or searches for terms from a particular record field (e.g. a search for terms from the title). \n * A mathematical interpretation of stop word removal and stemming. \n * A mathematical interpretation of operators for mandatory terms, wildcards and synonyms. \n * A practical comparison of a language model-based retrieval system with similar systems that are based on well-established models and term weighting algorithms in a controlled experiment. \n * The application of the model to cross-language information retrieval and adaptive information filtering, and the evaluation of two prototype systems in a controlled experiment. \n \nExperimental results on three standard tasks show that the language model-based algorithms work as well as, or better than, today's top-performing retrieval algorithms. The standard tasks investigated are ad-hoc retrieval (when there are no previously retrieved documents to guide the search), retrospective relevance weighting (find the optimum model for a given set of relevant documents), and ad-hoc retrieval using manually formulated Boolean queries. The application to cross-language retrieval and adaptive filtering shows the practical use of respectively structured queries, and relevance feedback.\n\n==\n\nNing 2020:\n\nTitle: Multi-hop Interactive Cross-Modal Retrieval\n\nAbstract: Conventional representation learning based cross-modal retrieval approaches always represent the sentence with a global embedding feature, which easily neglects the local correlations between objects in the image and phrases in the sentence. In this paper, we present a novel Multi-hop Interactive Cross-modal Retrieval Model (MICRM), which interactively exploits the local correlations between images and words. We design a multi-hop interactive module to infer the high-order relevance between the image and the sentence. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, MS-COCO and Flickr30K, demonstrate that our multi-hop interactive model performs significantly better than several competitive cross-modal retrieval methods.\n\n==\n\nLafferty 2001:\n\nTitle: Document language models, query models, and risk minimization for information retrieval\n\nAbstract: We present a framework for information retrieval that combines document models and query models using a probabilistic ranking function based on Bayesian decision theory. The framework suggests an operational retrieval model that extends recent developments in the language modeling approach to information retrieval. A language model for each document is estimated, as well as a language model for each query, and the retrieval problem is cast in terms of risk minimization. The query language model can be exploited to model user preferences, the context of a query, synonomy and word senses. While recent work has incorporated word translation models for this purpose, we introduce a new method using Markov chains defined on a set of documents to estimate the query models. The Markov chain method has connections to algorithms from link analysis and social networks. The new approach is evaluated on TREC collections and compared to the basic language modeling approach and vector space models together with query expansion using Rocchio.

In this work, we propose techniques that improve upon this limitation by relying on random walks over structured knowledge graphs. Specifically, we use soft prompts to guide LMs to chain together their encoded knowledge by learning to map multi-hop questions to random walk paths that lead to the answer. Applying our methods on two T5 LMs shows substantial improvements over standard tuning approaches in answering questions that require 2-hop reasoning.\n\n==\n\nLafferty 2001:\n\nTitle: Document Language Models, Query Models, and Risk Minimization for Information Retrieval\n\nAbstract: We present a framework for information retrieval that combines document models and query models using a probabilistic ranking function based on Bayesian decision theory.

But Ronell's work is also remarkable in its style: her writing is characteristi cally tough, double entendre intended. It's difficult (because of its enormous scope and depth), and it's also gutsy, rough, edgy, and pushy, with a sort of streetwise candor. Indeed, Ronell herself identifies a kind of \"class struggle\" going down in her texts, a struggle involving her own various compulsions, denials, and voices?including the \"little hood lum,\" the \"high philosophical graduate student,\" and the \"more sophisti cated Parisian.\" Ronell notes, however, that the most discernible and continuous voice in her texts belongs to the \"wise-ass girl,\" an ancestor of the \"buffo\" and every bit an anacoluthon out to disrupt the \"smooth logic of accepted meaning or signification.\" This interruptive force? inasmuch as it does indeed \"startle, irritate, illuminate\"?takes a certain swipe at certitude, prompting rigorous hesitations that open the condi tions of possibility for what Ronell's works are always after: an ethics of decision in a postfoundational whirl(d).

The author, Fiona MacCarthy, is the curator of the National Portrait Gallery's 2014-15 exhibition Anarchy and Beauty: William Morris and His Legacy. \"One of the finest biographies ever published in this country\". (A. S. Byatt). Since his death in 1896, William Morris has come to be regarded as one of the giants of the Victorian era. But his genius was so many-sided and so profound that its full extent has rarely been grasped. Many people may find it hard to believe that the greatest English designer of his time, possibly of all time, could also be internationally renowned as a founder of the socialist movement, and could have been ranked as a poet together with Tennyson and Browning. With penetrating insight, Fiona MacCarthy has managed to encompass all the different facets of Morris' complex character, shedding light on his immense creative powers as artist and designer of furniture, fabrics, wallpaper, stained glass, tapestry and books, and as a poet, novelist and translator; his psychology and his emotional life; his frenetic activities as polemicist and reformer; and his remarkable circle of friends, literary, artistic and political, including Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones. Fiona MacCarthy's skilful drawing together of these disparate elements makes for a comprehensive and compelling biography.\n\n==\n\nSlights 2001:\n\nTitle: Rape and the Romanticization of Shakespeare's Miranda\n\nAbstract: In 1981, Jean Elshtain issued a plea that political philosophy recognize female agency as a valid focus of study: \u201cThe feminist political thinker aims to transform her discipline as well as her social world in important ways.

Her prolific output is widely recognised in discussions of contemporary black British theatre, where she is often named alongside Kwame Kwei-Armah and Roy Williams as the leading playwrights of their generation. Moreover, she has become a figurehead for new British playwriting more broadly, as evinced by her inclusion in Aleks Sierz\u2019 Rewriting the Nation: British Theatre Today (2011). Yet this energetic acclaim was preceded by a period of critical questioning; early reviewers responded indignantly to her subversion of conventional plot structures, highly stylised use of language and assuredly sparse stage design. Many saw these features as a failure to fulfil the demands of the dramatic medium; some hesitated to use the term \u201cplay\u201d to classify her work. One critic, receiving her drama as an aural rather than visual or embodied experience, claimed that she would \u201cfind a happier home on [BBC] Radio 3\u201d (I. Johns). In another particularly piqued response, reviewer Dominic Cavendish parodied the demotic voice in which tucker green\u2019s characters speak: \u201cI don\u2019t do silence, innit\u201d (251). This invocation of silence \u2013 or, rather, its absence \u2013 is intriguing. Cavendish is right that tucker green\u2019s plays are marked by chaotic dialogue: incessant repetition, overlap and interruption. Yet, amidst this proliferation of speech, much remains unsaid.

These included Lady Betty , by Christabel Coleridge, and Herbert Tresham , by the Revd J. M. Neale. Christabel Coleridge's novel is criticised mainly for its plot, which the anonymous reviewer finds badly constructed, tedious and implausible, while the Revd Neale's book is faulted both for being \u2018pedantically written\u2019, and for telling an \u2018insignificant\u2019 tale which the reviewer believes is \u2018a mere pretext for thrusting the author's opinions down the reader's throat\u2019. The review identifies no redeeming features in Herbert Tresham , but acknowledges that Lady Betty does contain \u2018some pleasing writing\u2019, and therefore suggests that Christabel Coleridge is \u2018capable of something better\u2019. What is notable, however, is that Lady Betty's faults are ascribed to the writer's sex, while this is not the case with the Revd Neale's novel. The review of Christabel Coleridge's text begins: \u2018It scarcely needed the author's name affixed to the title page of \u201cLady Betty\u201d, to tell us it was the work of a lady\u2019 \u2013 and goes on to call the novel's story \u2018feeble and badly designed\u2019, as if this were the natural corollary of female authorship. By contrast, the pedantry and offensive didacticism of Herbert Tresham are not linked to the Revd Neale's sex, or even to his clerical status. These reviews represent a minor instance of a practice endemic to nineteenth-century literary criticism \u2013 the ascription of particular characteristics to writing on the basis of its author's sex. Although this happened to texts by writers of both sexes, the practice was more common in discussions of women's publications.", "final_summary": "I'm sorry, but none of the papers provided seem to contain any criticism or discussion of Rona Moss-Morris.

Yet, these courses have many shortcomings in terms of materials, pedagogy and teacher attitudes. This paper explores Grades 7 and 8 (ages 13 and 14) students\u2019 experiences in Citizenship and Human Rights Education courses on the basis of qualitative data collected through focus group discussions in Ankara and Istanbul in the 2006\u20132007 academic year. The responses of the students indicate that these courses have had little impact in empowering students or in facilitating them to consider their own or others\u2019 human rights as an integral part of their lives. Rather, the students perceive the national and the global arena as characterized by mass human rights violations against which they feel powerless.

In the eyes of their defenders they are a sine qua non for the peace and the welfare of mankind and for democratic ideals. On the other hand the human rights records of many countries are still very poor and in some cases even scandalous. Thus the promotion and the reinforcement of human rights, their propagation, cultivation, and protection everywhere, depend upon the ceaseless efforts of all those concerned, including both official authorities and civil societies alike. As part of these efforts, studies on the attitudes of strategic social groups such as youth, women, and minorities with regard to human rights may provide some useful information and clues for both theoretical understanding and practical, preventive, and corrective purposes.' In view of this, the present study attempts to uncover certain facts concerning the awareness of and the support for human rights in one such strategic group in Turkey: university students.2\n\n==\n\n\u015een 2018:\n\nTitle: The Rise and Fall of Citizenship and Human Rights Education in Turkey.\n\nAbstract: Purpose: This article shows the effects of competing political forces on citizenship education in Turkey during the period of commitment to European Union (EU) accession (1999-2005). Methodology: It draws on textbooks, archival documents and interviews. Whilst Turkey had a history of civic education to promote a secular national ethos and identity, the post-Cold War democratisation movement encouraged the Turkish government in 1995 to attempt to internationalise civics by adding human rights themes. Findings: This effort occurred at a time when the hegemony of the secular nationalist establishment was challenged by the electoral rise of an Islamist party. Although Citizenship and Human Rights course suited the purposes of the secular nationalist establishment, after the EU recognised Turkey as a candidate in 1999, a new political Islamist government, elected in 2002, chose first to align the course with its ideology and later decided to repeal it. By exploring the evolution of the curriculum in a crucial period in which political power was switching from the ideology of secular nationalism to that of religious (Islamist) nationalism, the present study illustrates ways in which external and internal influences may affect citizenship education. In particular, it contributes to debates over the role of international agencies in curriculum change in citizenship education.\n\n==\n\n\u015een 2021:\n\nTitle: How are human rights presented in Turkey\u2019s textbooks? Development of an escapist model of human rights education (1950-2020)\n\nAbstract: ABSTRACT Drawing on a critical conceptualisation of human rights education (HRE), this study investigates how human rights were presented in a set of textbooks which were used in Turkey from 1950 to 2020. Findings show that the textbooks avoid human rights issues, struggles, campaigns, and activists by sustaining a de-politicised and de-contextualised narrative. They do not even refer to the Holocaust in explaining the historical development of human rights. These findings suggest that HRE gained a curricular status as a matter of window dressing, an \u2018escapist\u2019 model developed as a result. This model is characterised by a deliberate avoidance of anything that may be considered as \u2018political\u2019. This study concludes that placing socio-political issues at the centre of HRE and encouraging learners to critically reflect on discrepancies between claims and realities of human rights can improve the transformative powers of HRE in nationalist contexts with no strong tradition of rights struggle.\n\n==\n\nKaraman\u2010Kepenek\u00e7i 2005:\n\nTitle: Citizenship and Human Rights Education: A Comparison of Textbooks in Turkey and the United States\n\nAbstract: sues of today\u2019s world (Baehr, 1999; Buergental, 1995; Provost, 2002) and are essential to protect and improve human beings to ensure the national and world peace (Reardon, 2002). One of the important ways to secure human rights is known to be human rights education (Branson & Purta, 1982), which in turn is related to citizenship education. It is undoubtedly essential that human beings make use of the rights they own in order to be responsible citizens. However, making use of the rights primarily depends on humans knowing what rights they own. Are human beings aware and/or making use of the rights they have? It would not be so easy to answer this question as \u201cyes.\u201d Then we are faced with two questions: Should human rights be known by all human beings? Should human rights be utilized at the highest possible level? It is an obvious fact that this problem can be surmounted through education in this field through, briefly expressed, \u201ccitizenship and human rights education\u201d (G\u00fclmez, 2001; KaramanKepenekci, 1999a). There are a number of studies (Bajaj, 2004; Charles, 1991; Cogan, 1999; Goehring, Kurtz, & Rosenthal, 2000; Hornberg, 2002; Karaman-Kepenekci, 1999a; Lenhart & Savolainen, 2002; Lohrenscheit, 2002; Patrick, 1999) focused on citizenship and human rights education. Martin (1987) claims that for citizenship and human rights education to be successful, it is crucial that this education be applied effectively. A number of factors are shown to be important for an effective human rights education: democratic school and class climate (Balton, 1992; Bottery, 1999; Branson & Purta, 1982; Drubay, 1986; G\u00fclmez, 2001; Karaman-Kepenekci, 1999b; Pettman, 1984; Richardson, 1979), positive teacher behavior (Campos, 1989; Charles, 1991; Drubay, 1986; Karaman-Kepenekci, 1998; Pettman, 1984; UNESCO, 1969), contribution from other courses taught at school (Drubay, 1986; Karaman-Kepenekci, 2000; UNESCO, 1985; UNESCO, 1969; Vandenburg, 1984), and a separate course for citizenship and human rights education (Hornberg, 2002; Karaman-Kepenekci, 2000).\n\n==\n\nKepenekci 2005:\n\nTitle: A study of effectiveness of human rights education in Turkey\n\nAbstract: The aim of the research is to examine the effectiveness of Civics and Human Rights Education courses taught in primary schools in Turkey.

For this aim, ten mother tongue textbooks from both countries were examined. Content analysis method was used to analyse the textbooks. As a result, it was observed that human rights issues are included more in Turkish textbooks when compared to French textbooks. It was found that in the textbooks of both countries the 'rights' subcategory is included the most while the 'justice' subcategory is included the least. While the intensity scores of the 'democracy' and 'freedom' subcategories were listed toward the very end in the textbooks of both countries, the 'democracy' subcategory occupies more places in French textbooks whereas the 'freedom' subcategory occupies more places in Turkish textbooks. Besides, the intensity scores for the subcategories of 'rights', 'peace' and 'tolerance' hold the first three places in the mother tongue textbooks of both countries.", "final_summary": "Human rights education (HRE) in Turkey has been a topic of considerable interest and debate in recent years.

One major unknown in current peatland emission estimations is how much peat is combusted by fire. Using a light detection and ranging data set acquired in Central Kalimantan, Borneo, in 2007, one year after the severe peatland fires of 2006, we determined an average burn scar depth of 0.33 \u00b1 0.18 m. Based on this result and the burned area determined from satellite imagery, we estimate that within the 2.79 million hectare study area 49.15 \u00b1 26.81 megatons of carbon were released during the 2006 El Ni\u00f1o episode. This represents 10\u201333% of all carbon emissions from transport for the European Community in the year 2006. These emissions, originating from a comparatively small area (approximately 13% of the Indonesian peatland area), underline the importance of peat fires in the context of green house gas emissions and global warming. In the past decade severe peat fires occurred during El Ni\u00f1o-induced droughts in 1997, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2009. Currently, this important source of carbon emissions is not included in IPCC carbon accounting or in regional and global carbon emission models. Precise spatial measurements of peat combusted and potential avoided emissions in tropical peat swamp forests will also be required for future emission trading schemes in the framework of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in developing countries.\n\n==\n\nPage 2002:\n\nTitle: The amount of carbon released from peat and forest fires in Indonesia during 1997\n\nAbstract: Tropical peatlands are one of the largest near-surface reserves of terrestrial organic carbon, and hence their stability has important implications for climate change. In their natural state, lowland tropical peatlands support a luxuriant growth of peat swamp forest overlying peat deposits up to 20 metres thick. Persistent environmental change\u2014in particular, drainage and forest clearing\u2014threatens their stability, and makes them susceptible to fire. This was demonstrated by the occurrence of widespread fires throughout the forested peatlands of Indonesia during the 1997 El Ni\u00f1o event. Here, using satellite images of a 2.5 million hectare study area in Central Kalimantan, Borneo, from before and after the 1997 fires, we calculate that 32% (0.79\u2009Mha) of the area had burned, of which peatland accounted for 91.5% (0.73\u2009Mha). Using ground measurements of the burn depth of peat, we estimate that 0.19\u20130.23\u2009gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon were released to the atmosphere through peat combustion, with a further 0.05\u2009Gt released from burning of the overlying vegetation. Extrapolating these estimates to Indonesia as a whole, we estimate that between 0.81 and 2.57\u2009Gt of carbon were released to the atmosphere in 1997 as a result of burning peat and vegetation in Indonesia. This is equivalent to 13\u201340% of the mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and contributed greatly to the largest annual increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration detected since records began in 1957 (ref. 1).\n\n==\n\nPark 2019:\n\nTitle: Estimation of Carbon Dioxide Budget From Peatland In Indonesia With Site-Level Validation\n\nAbstract: Peatland is a natural carbon reservoir in terrestrial ecosystem. The ground water table in peatland is a key factor for carbon exchange through soil decomposition or carbon sink. Especially, Indonesia has the biggest peatland area in Asia. This study focused on the carbon dioxide budget between emissions by ecosystem respiration including fire event and the absorption by photosynthesis. As the result, the annual average of net biome ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange during 12 years were reached to 195.03 MtC/yr. Over the three times of CO2 from fire emissions were emitted by ecosystem respiration from whole peatlands in Indonesia.\n\n==\n\nHusnain 2014:\n\nTitle: CO2 emissions from tropical drained peat in Sumatra, Indonesia\n\nAbstract: With the increasing use of tropical peatland for agricultural development, documentation of the rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is becoming important for national greenhouse gas inventories. The objective of this study was to evaluate soil-surface CO2 fluxes from drained peat under different land-use systems in Riau and Jambi Provinces, Sumatra, Indonesia. Increase of CO2 concentration was tracked in measurement chambers using an Infrared Gas Analyzer (IRGA, LI-COR 820 model). The results showed that CO2 flux under oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations ranged from 34\u2009\u00b1\u200916 and 45\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u00a0Mg CO2 ha\u20131\u00a0year\u20131 in two locations in Jambi province to 66\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u00a0Mg CO2 ha\u20131\u00a0year\u20131 for a site in Riau. For adjacent plots within 3.2\u00a0km in the Kampar Peninsula, Riau, CO2 fluxes from an oil palm plantation, an Acacia plantation, a secondary forest and a rubber plantation were 66\u2009\u00b1\u200925, 59\u2009\u00b1\u200919, 61\u2009\u00b1\u200925, 52\u2009\u00b1\u200917\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u20131\u00a0year\u20131, respectively, while on bare land sites it was between 56\u2009\u00b1\u200930 and 67\u2009\u00b1\u200924\u00a0Mg CO2 ha\u20131\u00a0year\u20131, indicating no significant differences among the different land-use systems in the same landscape. Unexplained site variation seems to dominate over land use in influencing CO2 flux. CO2 fluxes varied with time of day (p\u2009<\u20090.001) with the noon flux as the highest, suggesting an overestimate of the mean flux values with the absence of night-time measurements. In general, CO2 flux increased with the depth of water table, suggesting the importance of keeping the peat as wet as possible.\n\n==\n\nJauhiainen 2011:\n\nTitle: Carbon Dioxide emissions from an Acacia plantation on peatland in Sumatra, Indonesia\n\nAbstract: Abstract. Peat surface CO2 emission, groundwater table depth and peat temperature were monitored for two years along transects in an Acacia plantation on thick tropical peat (>4 m) in Sumatra, Indonesia. A total of 2300 emission measurements were taken at 144 locations, over a 2 year period. The autotrophic root respiration component of CO2 emission was separated from heterotrophic emission caused by peat oxidation in three ways: (i) by comparing CO2 emissions within and beyond the tree rooting zone, (ii) by comparing CO2 emissions with and without peat trenching (i.e. cutting any roots remaining in the peat beyond the tree rooting zone), and (iii) by comparing CO2 emissions before and after Acacia tree harvesting. On average, the contribution of autotrophic respiration to daytime CO2 emission was 21% along transects in mature tree stands. At locations 0.5 m from trees this was up to 80% of the total emissions, but it was negligible at locations more than 1.3 m away. This means that CO2 emission measurements well away from trees were free of any autotrophic respiration contribution and thus represent only heterotrophic emissions. We found daytime mean annual CO2 emission from peat oxidation alone of 94 t ha\u22121 y\u22121 at a mean water table depth of 0.8 m, and a minimum emission value of 80 t ha\u22121 y\u22121 after correction for the effect of diurnal temperature fluctuations, which may result in a 14.5% reduction of the daytime emission. There is a positive correlation between mean long-term water table depth and peat oxidation CO2 emission. However, no such relation is found for instantaneous emission/water table depth within transects and it is clear that factors other than water table depth also affect peat oxidation and total CO2 emissions. The increase in the temperature of the surface peat due to plantation establishment may explain over 50% of peat oxidation emissions. Our study sets a standard for greenhouse gas flux studies from tropical peatlands under different forms of agricultural land management. It is the first to purposefully quantify heterotrophic CO2 emissions resulting from tropical peat decomposition by separating these from autotrophic emissions. It also provides the most scientifically- and statistically-rigorous study to date of CO2 emissions resulting from anthropogenic modification of this globally significant carbon rich ecosystem. Our findings indicate that past studies have underestimated emissions from peatland plantations, with important implications for the scale of greenhouse gas emissions arising from land use change, particularly in the light of current, rapid agricultural conversion of peatlands in the Southeast Asian region.\n\n==\n\nArifanti 2021:\n\nTitle: Mangrove deforestation and CO2 emissions in Indonesia\n\nAbstract: Mangroves are unique intertidal ecosystems that are experiencing high rates of deforestation throughout the world. Indonesia that has the highest mangrove cover in the world has lost its mangroves significantly in 1980s with the expansion of aquaculture development due to the increased shrimp price during the Asian economic crisis. Mangrove loss emits a significant amount of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere that contributes to the global warming. This study aims to estimate the extent of mangrove deforestation in Indonesia and the potential greenhouse gas emissions generated from mangrove deforestation in the last decade. We analyzed the land cover maps produced by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry from 2009 to 2019 to calculate mangrove deforested areas as activity data. The average emission factor from mangrove deforestation is 136.9 MgCO2e ha-1yr-1, based on a meta-analysis from mangrove studies in Indonesia. Our result shows the total mangrove loss in the period of 2009 \u2013 2019 covers an estimated area of 182,091 ha. The spatial analysis suggests that the main drivers of mangrove deforestation were derived from conversion of mangroves to low vegetated areas, aquaculture and agriculture practices. Mangrove deforestation potentially generates a significant amount of 182.6 MtonCO2e to the atmosphere within 10 years. If mangrove loss continues, a significant amount of greenhouse gases will be accumulated in the atmosphere and negatively affect their unique biodiversity. Halting mangrove deforestation and conserving the remaining mangrove forests is the most cost effective and efficient measure to reduce CO2 emissions and mitigate climate change.\n\n==\n\nTohir 2019:\n\nTitle: Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on highland peatland that has been planted with coffee in Humbang Hasundutan Regency, North Sumatra Province\n\nAbstract: Peatlands in Indonesia are estimated at 26 millions ha. These peatlands are spread across Sumatra on of 8.9 million ha areas. Humbang Hasundutan is one of the area that spread peatlands in North Sumatra with an estimated area of around 1,042 hectares spread in Lintong Nihuta District, Pollung District and Dolok Sanggul District. Peat in this area is unique and rare because the general peat is founded in lowlands adjacent to the coast, but peat in Humbang Hasundutan area is a highland (topogenous) peat which lies at altitude 1000-1450 meters above sea level. The purpose of this study was to determined the amount of CO2 emissions on peatlands cultivated with coffee in Dolok Sanggul District, Humbang Hasundutan Regency. This study was conducted in Huta Bagasan Village, Dolok Sanggul District, Humbang Hasundutan Regency. This research method is a survey research of the amount of CO2 emissions on highland peatlands that are cultivated with coffee. CO2 sampling using a closed hood method. The sampling point is determined 75 cm from the plant. The sampling was taken 3 times a day, namely at 07.00 WIB, 12.00 WIB and 17.00 WIB. Based on the research was known that the highest CO2 emissions were found during the day at 8.12 mg/m2/day, followed by the afternoon at 7.67 mg/m2/day, and the lowest in the morning at 4.21 mg/m2/day.\n\n==\n\nPark 2013:\n\nTitle: Estimation of CO2 budget on peatlands in indonesia by using satellite based data\n\nAbstract: The peatlands are known as the carbon sink in natural. However some disturbances such as fire and drainage are occurred in Indonesian peatlands. The declining of ground water table is the most influential reason of carbon emission from peatlands. For detecting CO2 emission from peatlands in Indonesia, ground water table was estimated by satellite based precipitation and land surface temperature. The CO2 emission is represented by NEE(Net Ecosystem CO2 Exchange) which can be calculated with this equation; NEE = ER - GPP; where ER is ecosystem respiration, and GPP is gross primary productivity. As the result, the ecosystem respiration was larger than GPP in this peat forest. The annual average of ER was about twice of GPP in this region. The GPP of MOD17A2 is underestimated from in-situ observed GPP with 37.2%. The CO2 emission through fire and respiration is increased when GWT was declined.", "final_summary": "Peatland deforestation and degradation in Indonesia significantly contribute to global CO2 emissions. Ballhorn (2009) estimated that the 2006 El Ni\u00f1o episode resulted in the release of 49.15 \u00b1 26.81 megatons of carbon from a 2.79 million hectare area in Central Kalimantan, Borneo. This is equivalent to 10-33% of all carbon emissions from transport for the European Community in 2006. Similarly, Page (2002) estimated that between 0.81 and 2.57 gigatons of carbon were released to the atmosphere in 1997 due to burning peat and vegetation in Indonesia, equivalent to 13-40% of the mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels.\n\nPark (2019) found that the annual average of net biome ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange over 12 years reached 195.03 MtC/yr, with over three times of CO2 from fire emissions being emitted by ecosystem respiration from all peatlands in Indonesia.

Lastly, Park (2013) found that the CO2 emission through fire and respiration increased when the ground water table declined.\n\nIn conclusion, the rate of CO2 emission from peatland deforestation and degradation in Indonesia is significant and varies depending on factors such as the depth of the water table and the time of day.

Recently, several authors have sug gested that racial attitudes of black children have changed in the decades since these studies (e.g.. Brand, Ruiz, & Padilla, 1974; Hraba & Grant, 1970). Hraba and Grant found greater numbers of black doll choices than Clark and Clark (1947). However, this result could have been due to regional differences or different amounts of inter racial contact, rather than to historical change. Similarly, McAdoo (1976) found more black choices over time in a longitudinal study, with children tested first in 1969 at 4-5 years and in 1974 at 9-10 years, but the greater age of the children at follow-up could explain the change as well as historical change in attitudes. It is difficult to study historical change unconfounded with age without using complicated cohort-sequential designs. However, if one has hypotheses concerning the active agent in historical change, one can, in a cross-sectional design, compare children who vary in exposure to this active agent. In the present case, if activism in the Black Movement is the relevant variable, as is often suggested, chil dren of activists should show higher levels of black choice than chil dren of nonactivists. Studies suggest that there are durable differences between activ ists and nonactivists.

Fifty-two African American parent-child dyads were participants. Results of a hierarchical regression revealed family adaptability and family cognitive reframing to be significant predictors of racial identity.

Students (N=114) at a southern liberal-arts college filled out an extensive survey about childhood activities and family of origin, and 40 of their mothers completed a similar survey. The Attitudes Toward Blacks (Brigham, 1993) scale measured racism. Several hypotheses were supported. Students who exhibited less racism also reported that they made more diverse friends in school, came from a more diverse hometown, had diverse encounters and friendships at an earlier age, and had more positive foreign travel experiences. In addition, more racist students perceived their mothers as being more prejudiced while they were growing up, and they perceived their fathers as being more prejudiced currently. Finally, students judged their mothers as less racist than their fathers, and also reported that their mothers exhibited less racist behaviors than did their fathers. The importance of racially diverse experiences and friendships early in life are discussed as means to decrease racism.\n\n==\n\nTaylor 1986:\n\nTitle: Receipt of Support from Family among Black Americans: Demographic and Familial Differences.\n\nAbstract: The impact of familial and demographic factors on the receipt of support from family members was examined among a sample of blacks (National Survey of Black Americans). The findings indicated that income, age, family contact, subjective family closeness, and proximity of relatives were determinants of receiving support. In addition, an interaction was revealed between age and the presence of a child in determining support from family members. The findings substantiate the importance of adult children in the informal social support networks of elderly blacks. The use of multivariate analyses extends previous work in this area and suggests that these relationships are more complex than originally thought.\n\n==\n\nAboud 1996:\n\nTitle: Parental and peer influences on children's racial attitudes\u2606\n\nAbstract: Abstract Two studies examined the hypothesis that children acquire racial attitudes from parents and friends. In the first study, the attitudes of third-grade White children, mean age 9 years, were measured with the Preschool Racial Attitude Measure and with the Multi-response Racial Attitude Measure; the children also predicted the attitudes of their parents on the latter. The perceptual differentiation within-race was assessed. Mothers completed the Katz-Hass attitude scale and the Linville differentiation measure. The results showed that, although children predicted parental attitudes to be similar to their own, the actual parent-child correlation was nonsignificant. However, the mother's differentiation was inversely related to her child's bias score on the PRAM. In the second study, children once again predicted friends' attitudes to be similar to their own. However, only one of several indices of attitude yielded a significant subject-friend correlation; also one subject-non-friend correlation was significantly positive. In each case, the correlations were moderate (between .35 and .40). Thus, there is little support for the widespread assumption that children acquire their racial attitudes from parents and friends. However, parents might indirectly influence their child's attitudes through their view of outgroup members as homogeneous or heterogeneous. Explanations for the children's expectations of similarity to parents and friends are offered.\n\n==\n\nMalaney-Brown 2022:\n\nTitle: The Influence of Familial Relationships: Multiracial Students\u2019 Experiences with Racism at a Historically White Institution\n\nAbstract: Multiracial college students\u2019 enrollment has increased significantly over the past decade. This study examined the experiences of multiracial college students at a historically White institution (HWI) in the Northeast\u2014particularly how student experiences within interracial family relationships\u2014prior to college and while enrolled in college have assisted them in navigating instances of racism. In this exploratory qualitative study, students indicated that their family members can provide support in understanding racism. However, it does depend on the type of relationship and support (e.g., strong, weak, or stressed) they receive from specific family members during their pre-college and college experiences. Multiracial students confirmed experiencing multiracial microaggressions and found that they receive the most family support from their siblings. Implications are provided for students, practitioners, and interracial families to empower multiracial students to confront racism while attending a HWI.\n\n==\n\nCastelli 2009:\n\nTitle: The transmission of racial attitudes within the family.\n\nAbstract: Previous literature based on self-report measures has not found a clear relationship between the ethnic attitudes of White parents and those of their children. In particular, no study has evidenced such a relationship in the case of preschool children. In the present study, the authors measured parents' implicit and explicit racial attitudes as well as the racial attitudes of their 3- to 6-year-old children. They found that parents' explicit attitudes were not related to children's responses. In contrast, mothers' implicit attitudes (but not fathers' implicit attitudes) were significant predictors of children's attitudes. Results demonstrate that early racial attitudes might develop within the family.\n\n==\n\nTaylor 2011:\n\nTitle: Community Influences on White Racial Attitudes: What Matters and Why?\n\nAbstract: Tracing the roots of racial attitudes in historical events and individual biographies has been a long-standing goal of race relations scholars. Recent years have seen a new development in racial attitude research: Local community context has entered the spotlight as a potential influence on racial views. The race composition of the locality has been the most common focus; evidence from earlier decades suggests that white Americans are more likely to hold anti-black attitudes if they live in areas where the African-American population is relatively large. However, an influential 2000 article argued that the socioeconomic composition of the white community is a more powerful influence on white attitudes: In low-socioeconomic status (SES) locales, \u201cstress-inducing\u201d deprivations and hardships in whites' own lives purportedly lead them to disparage blacks. The study reported here reassesses this \u201cscapegoating\u201d claim, using data from the 1998 to 2002 General Social Surveys linked to 2000 census information about communities. Across many dimensions of racial attitudes, there is pronounced influence of both local racial proportions and college completion rates among white residents. However, the economic dimension of SES exerts negligible influence on white racial attitudes, suggesting that local processes other than scapegoating must be at work.", "final_summary": "The influence of family members on racial attitudes during the civil rights movement is a complex and multifaceted issue, as evidenced by the diverse findings in the collected papers.\n\nBranch (1980) hypothesized that if activism in the Black Movement is the relevant variable, children of activists should show higher levels of black choice, indicating a potential influence of parental activism on racial attitudes.

Therefore, finding the variables that can solve them is an urgent aspect to achieve an adequate learning environment in the 21st century school. The aim of this study was to analyze what happens to disruptive behaviors in relation to systematic and regulated sports and social practice in a sample of Spanish primary school students. Five hundred and forty-eight schoolchildren (276 were girls (50.4%)) participated with a mean age of 10.98 (SD = 0.71).

With this in mind, we analyzed five PE sessions taken by pupils at different elementary school in the region of Murcia. The total sample size was 96 students aged between 10 and 13. Data was recorded using an observation instrument (a combination of a field format and a categorical system) and was then analyzed using the \u201cHOISAN\u201d software tool, with a sequential analysis and polar coordinates being conducted. The results of the study revealed that disruptive behaviors (52\u00a0%) occur more frequently than non-relevant behaviors (48\u00a0%), the most common of them being disinterested behavior (29\u00a0%), followed by indiscipline (15\u00a0%), with no statistically significant differences being detected in violent behavior. As regards patterns of behavior, disinterested behavior is stimulated by \u201cno eye contact\u201d, \u201cmiddle distance\u201d, \u201cinside the task\u201d, \u201cno use of material\u201d, \u201cgiving orders\u201d and \u201cregistering of activities\u201d, while indiscipline is stimulated by \u201cno eye contact\u201d, \u201cfar distance\u201d, \u201coutside the task\u201d, \u201cuse of material\u201d, \u201cgrouping in pairs\u201d and \u201cpreparation of material\u201d.

This study had multiple phases, including instrument development, preliminary studies, content-related evidence study, and an exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency reliability study. Participants for the content-related evidence study were 27 experts in physical education pedagogy. They were sent items from the student disruptive behavior instrument and asked to organize them into 3 management severity categories. Participants for the factor analysis and internal consistency reliability study were 2,309 middle and high school students from 2 states. The following 6 factors emerged from the exploratory factor analysis: (a) aggressive, (b) low engagement or irresponsibility, (c) fails to follow directions, (d) illegal or harmful, (e) distracts or disturbs others, and (f) poor self-management. Alpha reliability coefficients for the factors were mostly above .70 and the rotated factor loadings for the items ranged from .26 to .73.

Therefore, the main objective of this research was to analyse the effects of perceived teaching competence, motivation and basic psychological needs on disruptive behaviours in secondary school PE students. The sample was composed of 758 adolescent students from seven public secondary schools. The following instruments adapted to physical education were used: The Disruptive Behaviours Questionnaire, The Evaluation of Teaching Competencies Scale, The Sport Motivation Scale, and The Basic Psychological Needs Scale. Multilevel regression models with the MIXED procedure were performed for data analysis. The results show that misbehaviour is more likely among male students and that disruptive behaviours decrease when a teacher is perceived as competent. Students with greater self-determined motivation are more likely to exhibit fewer behaviours related to low engagement and irresponsibility while amotivation increases the different disruptive behaviours in the classroom. In conclusion, it is proposed that educators work in line with the students\u2019 needs by responding to their interests and that this will increase self-determined motivation.", "final_summary": "Disruptive behavior in physical education classes is a complex issue that has been the focus of numerous studies.

Prior to 1997 goalkeepers were required to remain still until the ball was struck. The objective of this study was to determine the importance of the penalty kick in the modern game of football. A retrospective study of the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cup and the 2000, 2004 and 2008 European Championship tournaments was carried out, assessing the importance of the penalty kick in match play and shootouts and the effect of the time of the game on the shooter's success rate. This study demonstrated the conversion rate of penalties was 73% in shootouts and 68% in match play. Significantly more penalties were awarded late in the game: twice as many penalties in the second half than the first and close to four times as many in the fourth quarter vs. the first. Teams awarded penalty kicks during match play won 52%, drew 30% and lost 18% of the time; chances of winning increased to 61% if the penalty was scored, but decreased to 29% if missed. Teams participating in either the World Cup or European Championship final match had roughly a 50% chance of being involved in a penalty shootout during the tournament. Penalty shots and their outcome significantly impact match results in post 1997 football.\n\n==\n\nPlessner 2001:\n\nTitle: Sequential effects in important referee decisions: the case of penalties in soccer.\n\nAbstract: In a study on penalty decisions in soccer, 115 participants made decisions as referees for each of 20 videotaped scenes from an actual match. In three scenes, defenders committed potential fouls in their penalty area. The first two scenes involved the same team and the third scene occurred in the opposite penalty area. Consistent with the assumption that judges\u2019 initial decisions have an impact on later decisions, we found a negative correlation between participants\u2019 successive penalty decisions concerning the same team, and a positive correlation between successive penalty decisions concerning first one and then the opposing team.\n\n==\n\nSchwarz 2011:\n\nTitle: Compensating tendencies in penalty kick decisions of referees in professional football: Evidence from the German Bundesliga 1963\u20132006\n\nAbstract: Abstract Using a large representative database (12,902 matches from the top professional football league in Germany), I show that the number (441) of two-penalty matches is larger than expected by chance, and that among these 441 matches there are considerably more matches in which each team is awarded one penalty than would be expected on the basis of independent penalty kick decisions (odds ratio = 11.2, relative risk = 6.34). Additional analyses based on the score in the match before a penalty is awarded and on the timing of penalties, suggest that awarding a first penalty to one team raises the referee's penalty evidence criterion for the same team, and lowers the corresponding criterion for the other team.\n\n==\n\nKrenn 2017:\n\nTitle: Do Red and Blue Uniforms Matter in Football and Handball Penalties?\n\nAbstract: Past research has revealed ambiguous results on the impact of red uniforms in sports competition. The current study was aimed at analyzing the role of red and blue uniforms in football and handball penalties. Two experiments were conducted using a within subjects design, where participants rated uniform color-manipulated video clips. In the first study, participants (n = 39) watched footage of football players kicking a penalty, whereas in the second study (n = 118) videos of handball penalty takers, handball goalkeepers and football goalkeepers preparing themselves to score/save a penalty were shown. Participants rated player's/goalkeeper's level of confidence and the expected position of the ball crossing the goal line in the first experiment and additionally the probability of scoring the penalty against the goalkeepers in the second experiment. The videos stopped at the point where the ball was leaving the foot and hand respectively. Results did not show any beneficial impact of red uniforms. Rather, football players wearing blue were rated to kick the ball higher. The study contradicts any positive effect of red versus blue uniforms in the context of football and handball penalties, which emphasizes the need of searching for potential moderators of color's impact on human behavior.\n\n==\n\nMisirlisoy 2014:\n\nTitle: Asymmetric Predictability and Cognitive Competition in Football Penalty Shootouts\n\nAbstract: Sports provide powerful demonstrations of cognitive strategies underlying competitive behavior. Penalty shootouts in football (soccer) involve direct competition between elite players and absorb the attention of millions. The penalty shootout between Germany and England in the 1990 World Cup semifinal was viewed by an estimated 46.49% of the UK population. In a penalty shootout, a goalkeeper must defend their goal without teammate assistance while an opposing series of kickers aim to kick the ball past them into the net. As in many sports, the ball during a penalty kick often approaches too quickly for the goalkeeper to react to its direction of motion; instead, the goalkeeper must guess the likely direction of the kick, and dive in anticipation, if they are to have a chance of saving the shot. We examined all 361 kicks from the 37 penalty shootouts that occurred in World Cup and Euro Cup matches over a 36-year period from 1976 to 2012 and show that goalkeepers displayed a clear sequential bias. Following repeated kicks in the same direction, goalkeepers became increasingly likely to dive in the opposite direction on the next kick. Surprisingly, kickers failed to exploit these goalkeeper biases. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring and predicting sequential behavior in real-world competition. Penalty shootouts pit one goalkeeper against several kickers in rapid succession. Asymmetries in the cognitive capacities of an individual versus a group could produce significant advantages over opponents.\n\n==\n\nLeal 2017:\n\nTitle: What Happens on the Field Stays on the Field: Exploring the Link between Football Player Penalties and Criminal Arrests\n\nAbstract: ABSTRACT Research in organizations has tended to focus only on performance in the workplace and until recently has not paid much attention to behavior outside of the workplace. Conversely, the limited research on crime in the National Football League (NFL), the type of organization we study, has focused largely on misbehavior off-the-field. We confluence these lines of research by focusing on both on-duty and off-duty behaviors. We examine the relationship between on-duty behavior, measured through both the number of penalties and total penalty yards accumulated by an NFL player, as well as their off-duty behavior, measured through criminal arrests. Findings show that a higher number of penalties and a higher total number of penalty yards is associated with more total arrests, more nonviolent arrests, but has no effect on violent arrests. These findings hold in the regular but not post-season.\n\n==\n\nHughes 2002:\n\nTitle: Analysis of penalties taken in shoot-outs\n\nAbstract: Penalties are now a subject of myth, romance, excitement, dread, fear and pressure - depending upon whether you are watching or taking them. Many soccer managers and coaches have said that they are a lottery and many are of the opinion that practising them are a waste of time, because it is not possible to replicate the pressure. Little research has been completed on penalty shoot-outs, and most of this has been on the performance of goalkeepers. The aim of this work is to use notation to analyse the performances of the penalty takers and goalkeepers in penalty shoot-outs taken from the FIFA World Cup finals and also the finals of the European Champions League, and present these data so that a successful profile of optimal performance can be defined. A notation system was designed to input data directly into Access, 129 penalties were notated with an intention to analyse the time in preparing the shot, the number of paces taken to approach the ball, their relative pace, the pace of the shot, its placement and the outcome. It was found that:- \u2022 One in five saved (20%; 3/15), one in fifteen missed (7%; 1/15) and three in four scored (73%; 11/15).\u2022 25% of shots a fast run are saved because the player then tried either 50% or 75% power.\u2022 Best success ratios are from an even run up of 4, 5 and 6 paces.\u2022 There is no laterality in the success ratios \u2013 left footed and right footed strikers have the same success when the frequencies are represented as percentages.\u2022 No shots above waist height were saved, although 18% of those shots missed.\u2022 In every case, the goalkeeper moved off the line before the ball was struck.\u2022 There is only a small data set, but the goalkeepers who took a pace forward and stood up while the striker approached the ball, had the best save and miss ratios.\u2022 The profile of Germany\u2019s penalty takers show a consistent pattern that is very different from the average, indicating analysis and training.

The step from announcement to advertisement came with the recognition that making the product known to people formed an integral part of sales; or, to paraphrase Clausewitz, when this was recognised as a continuation of sales by other means. An early formulation of the idea was presented in 1904 by American advertising guru John E. Kennedy, whose simple but ingenious thesis was: \u2018advertising is salesmanship in print\u2019 (Pope, 1983, 238).\n\n==\n\nVadalkar 2021:\n\nTitle: A critical review of international print advertisements: evolutionary analysis, assessment and elucidations, from 1965 to 2020\n\nAbstract: PurposeAmidst the plethora of mass communication methods that technology bestowed business with, print advertisements still remain an effective and widely utilized advertising tool, and retain a diachronically venerable position in international marketing practice.

Due to the recent growth and interest in the advertising area, the present study investigates the intellectual body of research built over the last decade, by utilizing a bibliometric approach. The analysis consists of two different studies. The first study examines the top three academic journals specifically focused on advertising (JA, JAR and JCIRA) as the top benchmark for advertising research. The second is more comprehensive with multiple sources of advertising scholarship, ranging across a variety of communications, management and marketing journals. The studies taken together provide a holistic and in-depth analysis of authors, institutions, designations and productivity in the advertising area, thus further adding to the intellectual body of knowledge.

This paper addresses that frustration and compares sources of advertising data. The paper concludes that data provided by a private vendor on measured-media consumer advertising represents the best choice, but involves substantial effort to link it to the Census industrial classification system. The authors do this for 284 manufacturing industries for Census years 1967 and 1982. Comparisons of industry advertising levels and advertising-to-sales ratios are given. Relative advertising levels and intensities have remained remarkably stable over the 15 year period.\n\n==\n\nEechambadi 1994:\n\nTitle: Does advertising work\n\nAbstract: Advertising's effectiveness is notoriously difficult to measure -- but accurately valuing its contribution is more important than ever DESPITE THEIR HEIGHTENED ATTENTION to advertising spend, managers still have a hard time getting it precisely right. This should occasion no surprise: the task is extremely -- perhaps even impossibly -- difficult. There are problems everywhere: data are often unreliable, internal accounting and control systems irrelevant, performance criteria inappropriate, budgets unpredictable, time horizons for decisions unclear or unreasonable, and managerial incentives unfocused. These problems do not remove the burden of getting it right. But they do redefine a bit the yardstick by which \"right\" gets measured. Greater accuracy and precision are, of course, always welcome. But the primary merit of any new approach to making decisions about advertising spend is to embed throughout an organization a consistent, shared discipline for systematically thinking through the complex dynamics of value creation and capture. Such consistent discipline is especially important given the relatively fragile state of knowledge about the true economic value of advertising. There are, for example, a couple of facts about advertising that almost everyone knows. For much of the 1980s, ad spending boomed at a double-digit clip. Then, in the 1990s, expenditure began to decline in real terms. Among managers as well as students of advertising, two competing theories have developed to explain these conflicting trends: 1.Advertisers were overspending during the 1980s, or they are underspending today, or both. 2.Either (or both) rate of spending is right -- it is simply that the nature of competition, the overall performance of the economy, and the role of advertising have changed from one decade to the next. Both theories are plausible and popular. Both are wrong. In fact, there is a third explanation: ad spending has become so disconnected from economic reality and from an understanding of how best to evaluate an ad's \"quality\" -- that is, its creativity -- that these numbers do not reflect much other than management's willingness to open its wallet. New approaches to thinking about advertising that are anchored in effective metrics of creativity and in the economic reality of value creation are therefore needed. The one described here focuses on the economic half of this equation. Based on existing market research techniques and information technology, which have eased tremendously the execution of such approaches, it provides managers with a rational, dependable tool for setting advertising budgets and monitoring advertising effectiveness. It also allows them to see how their products deliver value to individual market segments and learn how advertising can communicate this value to the consumer. Most of all, it helps to clarify the relationship between a dollar of media spend and a dollar of economic value. Many companies are adopting bits and pieces of this approach, although to date no large advertisers use it systematically. They tend to direct their approach toward the market as a whole and not toward the multiple segments they want to reach. Even so, they have all found genuine benefit in the disciplined thought process it helps create and institutionalize. A different model In most companies, senior management gives each brand manager his or her ad budget for the year. The budget is generally based on last year's, plus or minus a few percent. The brand manager then works with ad agencies and is \"free\" to spend the budget more or less as he or she pleases -- within, of course, the sharp financial constraints imposed by the need to deliver against tough, year-to-year P&Ls. This new approach works differently. It should be familiar to senior managers because it resembles the standard capital budgeting process that operates outside advertising. \u2026\n\n==\n\nSwayne 1987:\n\nTitle: Comparative advertising in horizontal business publications\n\nAbstract: Abstract Comparative advertising, the practice of comparing two or more named or unnamed products in an advertisement, is well known to industrial marketers. This article focuses on the use of comparative advertising in the three leading business publications: Business Week , Forbes , and Fortune . The authors studied approximately 2900 full-page advertisements from 1970 through 1985. It was found that there was a significant increase in the use of comparative advertising during this period; in fact, the use of comparative advertising nearly tripled from 1970 to 1985. Although the predominant use of comparative advertising involves implied comparisons, there has been a continuing increase in the use of the more aggressive strictly comparative format.\n\n==\n\nStevenson 1984:\n\nTitle: Comparative industrial advertising: The content and frequency\n\nAbstract: Abstract Comparative advertising is the pratice of comparing two or more named or unnamed products in an advertisement. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of comparative advertising in widely circulated industrial publications. The study examined approximately 2100 full-page advertisements in major trade publications for the years 1970, 1975, and 1980. It was found that comparative advertising is not the dominant format for industrial journal advertising. Further, there was a significant decrease in the use of comparative advertising from 1975 to 1980. Nevertheless, when industrial advertisers use comparative advertising, they tend to rely more frequently on implied comparisons rather than on the more aggressive, strictly comparative format. Also, industrial marketers seem to be more inclined to stress product features rather than price, distribution, or promotion when using comparative advertising.", "final_summary": "The history of advertisement is a fascinating journey of evolving strategies and techniques.

This inherent weakness of an economic sector has negative impacts on, productivity, efficiency and performance. This paper takes the Jordanian construction industry as a case study of a developing economy and highlights the significant challenges it faces in implementing performance measurement. Findings from this study reveal a number of specific and general characteristics, and the extent and severity of industry-based barriers. The paper identifies a range of requirements at the national level that must be met to move from a state of relative disarray to an industry ready for the successful implementation of performance measurement and benchmarking.

In exploring this issue, this research asks three related questions: (1) how is sustainable procurement perceived in developing economies, (2) how can government regulation influence its application, and (3) what is the role of performance measurement in stimulating sustainable procurement practices? Answers are sought via an investigation exploring the underlying issues and challenges facing the construction industry of a developing country looking to address sustainable procurement. Using primary and secondary data sources, this research presents a case study of the Jordanian construction industry. Findings show that whilst sustainable procurement practices are promoted, it is still in its infancy - in part due to ineffective procurement frameworks and a lack of performance measurement. Current government regulations and policies are identified as an underlying cause, discouraging the development and adoption of sustainable procurement methods. As the Jordanian construction industry shares characteristics with other developing economies, it is expected that the findings of this paper will be of interest to professionals in those construction industries attempting to initiate sustainable procurement via performance measurement.\n\n==\n\nHiyassat 2016:\n\nTitle: Factors affecting construction labour productivity: a case study of Jordan\n\nAbstract: Improving productivity in construction is a way of increasing profit with little or no increase in cost. Labour productivity in construction in developing countries, including Jordan, is relatively low and needs to be improved significantly. The objective of this paper is to describe and analyse the factors that affect construction labour productivity. To achieve this goal, a questionnaire survey containing 27 questions (variables) was conducted. It was sent to 200 engineers and foremen who work for contractors. The 90 returned responses were statistically analysed by calculating the average, standard deviation, and RII of each variable. The results of a Spearman correlation\u2012rank\u2012coefficient test showed that no significant differences existed between the responses of the engineers and foremen. It was concluded that the top three ranked dimensions were \u2018Productivity increases as experience increases\u2019, \u2018Financial incentives increase productivity\u2019, and \u2018Trust and communications between management and workers increase productivity\u2019. Furthermore, the data was analysed using the principal components method of factor analysis. Of the 11 extracted factors, only five were considered, while the others were dropped since the observed variables had low loadings on these factors. Contractors and officials can benefit from this study in understanding factors affecting productivity, and act upon that understanding.\n\n==\n\nSweis 2008:\n\nTitle: Delays in construction projects: The case of Jordan\n\nAbstract: Abstract The construction industry is a major player in the economy, generating both, employment and wealth.

This paper aims to identify the barriers to adopt LC practices by taking a case of the Kingdom of Jordan. A questionnaire that included 30 barriers that were resulted from a comprehensive literature review was distributed and filled by 326 respondents from the Jordanian construction industry. The findings showed that the absence of support from the top management, low awareness toward LC, lack of training, and the absence of transparency are amongst the most serious factors that hinder the adoption of LC. The findings in this paper might be helpful to improve the knowledge about LC and support the adoption of new techniques that might improve the performance in the construction industry.\n\n==\n\nEl-Mashaleh 2007:\n\nTitle: Benchmarking information technology utilization in the construction industry in Jordan\n\nAbstract: This paper reports the findings of conducting a modified version of the IT barometer survey in the construction industry in Jordan. The study collects data from 207 firms. Thirty-four percent of these firms are general contractors, 37% are architecture and engineering firms, 19% are consulting and architecture and engineering firms, and 10% are consulting firms. The participating firms are involved in the construction of buildings, roads and bridges, water and sewage projects, and electromechanical projects. The size of firms in terms of number of employees varies widely with some firms have only one employee, while other firms have over 150 employees. The study shows that there is a 0.46 desktop computer and a 0.024 laptop computer per employee. Among the top software utilized by the industry are Word, Excel, web browsers, and e-mail. AutoCad dominates the production of engineering drawings with most firms utilize the software almost 100% of the time. Eighty-two percent of firms have increased their IT investment in the last two years. Eighty-five percent are committing more dollars to invest in IT in the next two years. According to 92% of respondents, demands from customers are a very important motivator for new IT investment. The perceived benefits for IT adoption according to the respondents are better quality of work, work done more quickly, better financial control, better communications, faster and simpler access to common data, greater felxibility to satisfy customers, possibility of sharing common information, easier to use lots of data, and possibility of telecommuting. The main obstacles for IT use are investment costs too high and greater know-how required from staff.

It also offers a comparison to US data. In 1999, almost two-thirds of FTSE 100 companies had at least one female director, but numbers had dropped by July 2000 from 64 per cent to 58 per cent, paralleling the levelling-off at top level reported in North America.

This paper examines the situation of female directors in the top 350 UK quoted companies in the context of recent debates about occupational gender differences and corporate governance. In particular, female non-executive directors account for just over 6 per cent of the non-executive directors and receive about two-thirds the remuneration of their male counterparts. Although female participation increases with firm size, the gender wage gap widens. More importantly, it was found that female nonexecutive directors are at a disadvantage in gaining promotions to positions such as chair of important board sub-committees (ie, the audit committee, the nomination committee and the remuneration committee) and as chairman of the board itself. Given that, in most companies, non-executive remuneration is related to the holding of such posts, this appears to be an important factor in explaining differences in non-executive remuneration. Exclusion of females from these powerful positions also suggests that women face a \u2018second glass ceiling\u2019 even after reaching board level. However, the latest version of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance now provides a valuable opportunity for UK company boards to address the issue of gender imbalance and independence on boards of directors.\n\n==\n\nHolton 1995:\n\nTitle: Corporate Governance Report Surveying the Situation for Women Directors in the UK\n\nAbstract: A survey \u2018Women on the Board of Britain's Top 200 Companies\u2019 published by Ashridge Management Research Group, 1993.\n\n==\n\nNsubuga 2020:\n\nTitle: Women on corporate boards of public listed companies \u2013 a UK and EU gender diversity conundrum\n\nAbstract: This chapter analyses the current state of affairs in relation to gender diversity on the boards of public listed companies in the UK and the EU. The chapter analyses the proposed European Union (EU) Directive on Women on Company Boards and related matters, the current stage of the proposed Directive and why it has not been adopted for over 7 years. The chapter analyses key conceptual underpinnings that may have contributed to the procedural paralysis in the adoption of the Directive. The position and current state of affairs on women on corporate boards of FTSE listed companies in the UK is examined, as well as initiatives taken by the UK government and institutional players to address this concern.

At a time of financial crisis and corporate governance failures, this lack of equality is considered especially problematic because the talents of half the workforce are not being utilised fully. This paper explores the possibility of introducing legislative gender quotas for company boardrooms in the UK. Such laws have been passed in Norway and Spain with dramatic results. Other countries, such as France and the Netherlands, look set to follow the examples of Norway and Spain.

We employ a novel dataset that covers a large sample of UK PLCs and describes a director\u2019s gender, ethnicity and position held. We find both ethnic and gender diversity to be very limited, and that diversity is somewhat less pronounced among executive positions. We find significant cross\u2010sector variation in gender diversity, with an above average prevalence of women in Retail, Utilities, Media and Banking, while such variation in ethnic diversity is considerably less pronounced. Our evidence suggests that a close proximity to final consumers plays a more significant role in shaping board diversity than does the female presence among the industry\u2019s workforce. We argue that this shows that board diversity is influenced by a firm\u2019s external business environment and particularly an imperative to reflect corresponding diversity among its customers.\n\n==\n\nGregory\ufffd?Smith 2014:\n\nTitle: Appointments, Pay and Performance in UK Boardrooms by Gender\n\nAbstract: This article uses UK data to examine issues regarding the scarcity of women in boardroom positions.

Evidence of gender-bias in the appointment of women as non-executive directors is found together with mixed evidence of discrimination in wages or fees paid. However, the article finds no support for the argument that gender diverse boards enhance corporate performance.

Similarly, Faulkner\u2019s The Sound and the Fury (1929) is focused on racialised time lag not simply between two points on a single historical line, but between different histories that move at different rates and go their own ways.

It has become a prominent issue in literary criticism in 20th century. Because time structure plays an enormously important role in the construction of story/novel, the other elements of the novel/story cannot be viewed without temporal space. It is temporal space/structure on which the events of the story are based and rhythm, flow and continuity of the story can be maintained by temporal space. Events cannot exist out of the temporal structure of the story. \nThis study deals with the temporal structure and its role in the novel \u201cKiller of Hamza\u201d by Najeeb Gillani and attempts to reveal the method of constructing time in the novel by standing on temporal order and temporal paradoxes both types of retrieval and anticipation, as well as the structure of the rhythm of time such as the technique of speeding narration with its movements (The dialogue scene, the descriptive position) and the frequency of the three types (solitary, repetitive, author).\u00a0 In addition, the study concludes the discussion based on the findings.\n\n==\n\nAbdulrraziq 2021:\n\nTitle: Narratological Analysis of Temporality in Novel\n\nAbstract: This paper definitely attempts to intermingle them with regard to structural analysis.

In this article I use detailed textual analysis of the Saw series to expound how film sequels employ and complicate expected temporal and spatial relations in particular, I investigate how the Saw sequels tie space and time into their narrative, methodological and moral sensibilities. Far from being a gimmick or a means of ensuring loyalty to the franchise (one has to be familiar with the events of previous episodes to ascertain what is happening), it is my contention that the Saw cycle directly requests that we examine the nature of space and time, in terms of both cinematic technique and our lived, off-screen temporal/spatial orientations.\n\n==\n\nKim 2020:\n\nTitle: What Time Is It? Temporal Analysis of Novels\n\nAbstract: Recognizing the flow of time in a story is a crucial aspect of understanding it. Prior work related to time has primarily focused on identifying temporal expressions or relative sequencing of events, but here we propose computationally annotating each line of a book with wall clock times, even in the absence of explicit time-descriptive phrases. To do so, we construct a data set of hourly time phrases from 52,183 fictional books. We then construct a time-of-day classification model that achieves an average error of 2.27 hours. Furthermore, we show that by analyzing a book in whole using dynamic programming of breakpoints, we can roughly partition a book into segments that each correspond to a particular time-of-day. This approach improves upon baselines by over two hours. Finally, we apply our model to a corpus of literature categorized by different periods in history, to show interesting trends of hourly activity throughout the past. Among several observations we find that the fraction of events taking place past 10 P.M jumps past 1880 - coincident with the advent of the electric light bulb and city lights.\n\n==\n\nVorderer 2009:\n\nTitle: Suspense : Conceptualizations, Theoretical Analyses, and Empirical Explorations\n\nAbstract: Contents: Preface.

While we are arguably free to make use of Bach and his music in whatever historically informed or uninformed ways we find fitting, we ought also to be on the ethical alert for a kind of cultural narcissism in which we end up miscasting Bach in our own ideological image and proclaiming the authenticity of that image, and hence its prestige value, in support of our own agendas.\n\n==\n\nVarwig 2012:\n\nTitle: Metaphors of Time and Modernity in Bach\n\nAbstract: Narratives of music and modernity have been prominent in musicological writings of the past decade, and the place of Johann Sebastian Bach within these narratives has formed the subject of stimulating debates. Recent studies by Karol Berger and John Butt have aimed to integrate Bach9s Passion compositions into broadly conceived philosophical frameworks, in Berger9s case focusing specifically on changing perceptions of time from a premodern sense of circular stasis to a modern linear idea of progress. This article proposes an alternative model of historical inquiry into these issues by presenting a detailed look at attitudes to time in early eighteenth-century Protestant Leipzig. My approach reveals a complex constellation of conflicting ideas and metaphors that encompass notions of time as both circular and linear and evince a particular concern for the question of how to fill the time of one9s earthly existence productively. In this light, pieces like Bach9s St. Matthew Passion and Georg Philipp Telemann9s Brockes Passion can be understood to have offered a range of different temporal experiences, which depended on individual listening attitudes, performance decisions, and surrounding social conventions. I argue that only through paying close attention to these fluid and often incongruous discourses can we gain a sufficiently nuanced picture of how music may have reflected and shaped early eighteenth-century conceptions of time, history, and eternity.\n\n==\n\nButt 2010:\n\nTitle: Bach's Dialogue with Modernity: Perspectives on the Passions\n\nAbstract: Preface Introduction 1.

The author shows that this quadrumvirate not only borrowed from Bach's organ works in creating their own masterpieces, whether for keyboard, voice, orchestra, or chamber ensemble, but that they also reacted significantly to the music as performers, editors, theorists, and teachers. Furthermore, the book reveals how these four titans influenced one another as \"receptors\" of this repertory and how their mutual acquaintances-especially Clara Schumann-contributed as well. As the first comprehensive discussion of this topic ever attempted, Stinson's book represents a major step forward in the literature on the so-called Bach revival. He considers biographical as well as musical evidence to arrive at a host of new and sometimes startling conclusions. Filled with fascinating anecdotes, the study also includes detailed observations on how these composers annotated their personal copies of Bach's organ works. Stinson's book is entirely up-to-date and offers much material previously unavailable in English. It is meticulously annotated and indexed, and it features numerous musical examples and facsimile plates as well as an exhaustive bibliography. Included in an appendix is Brahms's hitherto unpublished study score of the Fantasy in G Major, BWV 572.

Adorno stand as two of the twentieth century's most important and most controversial musi cians. Both were profoundly marked by the experience and aftermath of the Third Reich. Moreover, both were composers, and, although neither is remem bered primarily for this, their understanding of composition enabled them to understand musical works \"from the inside.\" Furtw?ngler remains for many the greatest conductor ofthat century, unsurpassed?perhaps never equaled? in the central German Romantic repertoire of Ludwig van Beethoven, Johannes Brahms, Anton Bruckner, and Richard Wagner. His so-called subjectivism may be contrasted with the more \"timely\" and \"objective\" anti-Romanticism of the Neue Sachlichkeit movement associated with such musicians as Paul Hindemith and Otto Klemperer and, most celebratedly, with the score-bound literalism of Arturo Toscanini. Adorno, having studied composition with Alban Berg, became the preeminent theorist of musical modernism and its dialectical adversary, the \"culture industry.\" He provided much of the intellectual under pinning for the postwar serialism of the Darmstadt school of Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and others, and his unabashed modernist elitism has inspired and infuriated ever since.\n\n==\n\nAshby 2010:\n\nTitle: The pleasure of modernist music : listening, meaning, intention, ideology\n\nAbstract: The debate over modernist music has continued for almost a century: from Strauss's Elektra and Webern's Symphony Op.21 to John Cage's renegotiation of musical control, the unusual musical practices of the Velvet Underground, and Stanley Kubrick's use of Ligeti's Lux Aeterna in the epic film 2001. The composers discussed in these pages -- including Bartok, Stockhausen, Bernard Herrmann, Steve Reich, and many others -- are modernists in that they are defined by their individualism, whether covert or overt, and share a basic urge toward redesigning musical discourse. The aim of this volume is to negotiate a varied and open middle ground between polemical extremes of reception. The contributors sketch out the possible significance of a repertory that in past discussions has been deemed either meaningless or beyond describable meaning. With an emphasis on recent aesthetics and contexts -- including film music, sexuality, metaphor, and ideas of a listening grammar -- they trace the meanings that such works and composers have held for listeners of different kinds. None of them takes up the usual mandate of \"educated listening\" to modernist works: the notion that a person can appreciate \"difficult\" music if given enough time and schooling. Instead the book defines novel but meaningful avenues of significance for modernist music, avenues beyond those deemed appropriate or acceptable by the academy. While some contributors offer new listening strategies, most interpret the listening premise more loosely: as a metaphor for any manner of personal and immediate connection with music. In addition to a previously untranslated article by Pierre Boulez, the volume contains articles (all but one previously unpublished) by twelve distinctive and prominent composers, music critics, and music theorists from America, Europe, Australia, and South Africa: Arved Ashby, Amy Bauer, William Bolcom, Jonathan Bernard, Judy Lochhead, Fred Maus, Andrew Mead, Greg Sandow, Martin Scherzinger, Jeremy Tambling, Richard Toop, and Lloyd Whitesell Arved Ashby is associate professor of music at the Ohio State University.\n\n==\n\nSchleifer 2011:\n\nTitle: Modernism and Popular Music: Contents\n\nAbstract: Traditionally, ideas about twentieth-century modernism \u2013 whether focused on literature, music, or the visual arts \u2013 have made a distinction between \u201chigh\u201d art and the \u201cpopular\u201d arts of best-selling fiction, jazz and other forms of popular music, and commercial art of one form or another. In Modernism and Popular Music, Ronald Schleifer instead shows how the music of George and Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, Thomas \u201cFats\u201d Waller, and Billie Holiday can be considered as artistic expressions equal to those of the traditional high modernist art practices in music and literature. Combining detailed attention to the language and aesthetics of popular music with an examination of its early twentieth-century performance and dissemination through the new technologies of the radio and phonograph, Schleifer explores the \u201cpopularity\u201d of popular music in order to reconsider received and seemingly self-evident truths about the differences between high art and popular art and, indeed, about twentieth-century modernism altogether.\n\n==\n\nKramer 2023:\n\nTitle: Classical Music and Postmodern Knowledge\n\nAbstract: Classical Music and Postmodern Knowledge. By Lawrence Kramer. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995.) (xvii, 297 p. ISBN 0-520-08820-4. $35.00.] In this, his third book on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century music as \"cultural practice,\" Lawrence Kramer takes on one of the thorniest problems facing musicology today: resistance to the idea that music means anything other than itself. He disagrees with those who believe that masterpieces are works which \"transcend all social utility\" and \"into which the social as such disappears without a trace\" (p. 235). Kramer wants to show the contrary. He is concerned about the future of \"classical\" music, which he finds \"losing both its prestige and its appeal.\" In a country that has reduced it to endless repetition on the radio and entertainment for an aging population, ho hopes to put this music back at the center of public discourse, where it was at the end of the last century. To this end, Kramer posits what he calls a number of \"postmodernist strategies of understanding.\" Not that this is a study about postmodernism in music: Jean-Francois Lyotard is cited as an authority only in passing and American postmodernist theorists like Frederic Jameson appear not at all. In his first chapter, Kramer questions the insistence on impartial rationality, the tendency to universalize and desire unity, the notion of subjectivity as alienated, and the communicative paradigms of modernist thought. But what really interests him is the \"musical pertinence\" (p. 13) of psychoanalysis, for it is the reception of music, rather than its composition or performance, that he sees as critical in determining its meaning. Lacanian psychoanalysis, he explains, is \"a theory of how certain articulations of identification and alienation, desire and law, continually 'mark' the field of communicative action\" (p. 12). Taking off from Theodor Adorno and Michel Foucault and bringing Ins understanding of Jacques Lacan's \"imaginary\" and \"symbolic,\" Julia Kristeva's \"abject,\" and Jacques Derrida's \"dissemination\" to his inquiry about the listening process, Kramer argues that listeners continually interact with what they hear. They listen (as they act), he tells us, \"not as a radiation from a central core of being, but as a circulation among positions to be taken in discourse and society.\" They respond in diverse ways contingent on their own situations. Their perspective is always \"partial,\" like Donna Haraway's description of the \"never finished, constituted\" self who \"does not seek partiality for its own sake, but for the sake of the connections and unexpected openings [its] situated knowledges make possible. The only way to find a larger vision is to be somewhere in particular\" (Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature [New York: Routledge, 1991], 196: quoted by Kramer on p. 7). Of course, this raises the problem of self and other: How does one interact with what is outside oneself? In other words, In the process of hearing music, what are the boundaries between the listener and the work? In the second chapter, Kramer points to the binary opposition, masculine/feminine, to explain how the self has come to be associated with \"reason, activity, progression, unity, and the integrity of boundaries, the other with irrationality, passivity, stasis or regression, fragmentation, and the crossing or dissolution of boundaries\" (p. 38). This, he argues, is a historical idea, \"not just a conceptual phenomenon, the consequences of which have too often been inhumane or worse ... [it] always has a moral dimension\" (p. 39). Kramer is particularly interested in \"the rhetoric of abjection\" in critical thinking about music, the attempt not to fuse with the other, but rather to reject it violently to preserve one's \"intactness\" (p. 58).

This suggests that Bach's music was not initially received as modernist, but rather as a reflection of premodern ideologies.\n\nVarwig (2012) presents a nuanced perspective, suggesting that Bach's music, particularly his Passion compositions, offered a range of temporal experiences that could be interpreted as both premodern and modern. This implies that the reception of Bach's music in terms of modernism may have been contingent on individual listening attitudes and social conventions of the time.\n\nWhile Butt (2010) and Stinson (2006) do not directly address the reception of Bach's music in terms of modernism, they provide valuable insights into how Bach's music influenced and was interpreted by later composers and performers.\n\nBerry (2008) and Ashby (2010) do not directly discuss the reception of Bach's music in the twentieth century in terms of modernist ideologies and aesthetics. However, they provide valuable insights into the works and ideas of musicians and composers in the twentieth century.\n\nSchleifer (2011) and Kramer (2023) do not directly address the reception of Bach's music in terms of modernism. They discuss broader cultural and aesthetic contexts, but not specifically in relation to Bach's music.\n\nIn conclusion, the reception of Bach's music in terms of modernism is a complex issue that has been interpreted in various ways depending on the cultural, aesthetic, and ideological contexts of the listeners. While Bach's music was not initially received as modernist, it has been continually reinterpreted in light of changing cultural and aesthetic contexts, suggesting that the reception of Bach's music in terms of modernism is a dynamic and ongoing process."}, {"query": "more than 40 session of cbt-e for resistant patients with eating disorders", "paper_list_string": "Byrne 2011:\n\nTitle: The effectiveness of enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy for eating disorders: an open trial.\n\nAbstract: The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of Enhanced Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT-E) for eating disorders in an open trial for adults with the full range of eating disorders found in the community. The only previously published trial of CBT-E for eating disorders was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in the U.K. for patients with a BMI \u2265 17.5. The current study represents the first published trial of CBT-E to include patients with a BMI<17.5. The study involved 125 patients referred to a public outpatient clinic in Perth, Western Australia. Patients attended, on average, 20-40 individual sessions with a clinical psychologist. Of those who entered the trial, 53% completed treatment. Longer waiting time for treatment was significantly associated with drop out. By the end of treatment full remission (cessation of all key eating disorder behaviours, BMI \u2265 18.5 kg/m(2), not meeting DSM-IV criteria for an eating disorder) or partial remission (meeting at least 2 these criteria) was achieved by two thirds of the patients who completed treatment and 40% of the total sample. The results compared favourably to those reported in the previous RCT of CBT-E, with one exception being the higher drop-out rate in the current study. Overall, the findings indicated that CBT-E results in significant improvements, in both eating and more general psychopathology, in patients with all eating disorders attending an outpatient clinic.\n\n==\n\nSignorini 2018:\n\nTitle: The Effectiveness of Enhanced Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT-E): A Naturalistic Study within an Out-Patient Eating Disorder Service.\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe effectiveness of enhanced cognitive behavioural Therapy (CBT-E) for adults with a range of eating disorder presentations within routine clinical settings has been examined in only two known published studies, neither of which included a follow-up assessment period.\n\n\nAIM\nThe current study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT-E within an out-patient eating disorder service in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, and incorporated a follow-up assessment period of approximately 20 weeks post-treatment.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe study involved 114 adult females with a diagnosed eating disorder, who attended an average of 20-40 individual CBT-E sessions with a psychologist or a psychiatry registrar between 2009 and 2013.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf those who began treatment, 50% did not complete treatment, and the presence of psychosocial and environmental problems predicted drop-out. Amongst treatment completers, statistically and clinically significant improvements in eating disorder and general psychopathology were observed at post-treatment, which were generally maintained at the 20-week follow-up. Statistically significant improvements in eating disorder and general psychopathology were observed amongst the total sample.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings, which were comparable to the previous Australian effectiveness study of CBT-E, indicate that CBT-E is an effective treatment for adults with all eating disorders within out-patient settings. Given the high attrition rate, however, minimizing drop-out appears to be an important consideration when implementing CBT-E within clinical settings.\n\n==\n\nFairburn 2015:\n\nTitle: A transdiagnostic comparison of enhanced cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT-E) and interpersonal psychotherapy in the treatment of eating disorders\n\nAbstract: Eating disorders may be viewed from a transdiagnostic perspective and there is evidence supporting a transdiagnostic form of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT-E). The aim of the present study was to compare CBT-E with interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), a leading alternative treatment for adults with an eating disorder. One hundred and thirty patients with any form of eating disorder (body mass index >17.5 to <40.0) were randomized to either CBT-E or IPT. Both treatments involved 20 sessions over 20 weeks followed by a 60-week closed follow-up period. Outcome was measured by independent blinded assessors. Twenty-nine participants (22.3%) did not complete treatment or were withdrawn. At post-treatment 65.5% of the CBT-E participants met criteria for remission compared with 33.3% of the IPT participants (p < 0.001). Over follow-up the proportion of participants meeting criteria for remission increased, particularly in the IPT condition, but the CBT-E remission rate remained higher (CBT-E 69.4%, IPT 49.0%; p = 0.028). The response to CBT-E was very similar to that observed in an earlier study. The findings indicate that CBT-E is potent treatment for the majority of outpatients with an eating disorder. IPT remains an alternative to CBT-E, but the response is less pronounced and slower to be expressed.

A few studies, most of which were performed by highly specialized research units, have indicated that enhanced cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT-E) for eating disorders can be effective. However, the dropout rate is high and the evidence from non-research clinical units is sparse.MethodsThis quality assessment project implemented CBT-E in an outpatient setting at a public hospital. Forty-four patients with AN started therapy. Each patient received at least 40 sessions of CBT-E over a 12-month period. Their body mass index (BMI) was recorded at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12\u00a0months. Reasons for not starting therapy or for leaving therapy prematurely were recorded.ResultsHalf (n\u2009=\u200922) of the 44 patients who started outpatient CBT-E did not complete the treatment. In the remaining sample there was a large (and statistically significant) weight gain after 12\u00a0months. The percentage of patients achieving the target BMI of >\u200918.5\u00a0kg/m2 was 36.4, 50.0 and 77.3% after 3, 6 and 12\u00a0months, respectively.ConclusionsThis quality assessment project shows that it is possible to establish effective CBT-E in an outpatient eating-disorder unit at a public hospital. Although half of the patients did not complete CBT-E, the remaining patients achieved a significant increase in BMI at 1\u00a0year after the start of therapy.\n\n==\n\nKarbasi 2010:\n\nTitle: Enhanced Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT-E) for Eating Disorders: Case Study of a Client With Anorexia Nervosa\n\nAbstract: This case study involved the treatment of a young adult female, referred to as \u201cMarie,\u201d who presented for treatment seeking help with her eating disorder. Marie evinced symptoms of dietary restriction, amenorrhea, low weight, and low body mass index (BMI); she was subsequently diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. She was treated with 20 sessions of enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-E), a relatively new, transdiagnostic treatment for eating disorders. Marie\u2019s progress throughout treatment is detailed in this case study report. Results supported the promising but limited body of research available on this treatment, which was highly effective for this client and, therefore, may be more generally useful for clients with anorexia nervosa.\n\n==\n\nJong 2016:\n\nTitle: Effectiveness of enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-E) for eating disorders: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial\n\nAbstract: BackgroundWhile eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) is the most common eating disorder (ED) diagnosis in routine clinical practice, no specific treatment methods for this diagnosis have yet been developed and studied. Enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-E) has been described and put to the test as a transdiagnostic treatment protocol for all EDs, including EDNOS. Initial research in the UK suggests that CBT-E is more effective for EDs, especially bulimia nervosa (BN) and EDNOS, than the earlier version of CBT. These positive results of CBT-E have to be replicated in more detail, preferably by independent researchers in different countries. Being the first Dutch study into CBT-E, the results from this national multicenter study \u2013 on three sites specialized in EDs \u2013 will deliver important information about the effectiveness of CBT-E in several domains of ED pathology, while providing input for the upcoming update of the Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline for the Treatment of Eating Disorders.Methods/designA multicenter randomized controlled trial will be conducted. One hundred and thirty-two adult outpatients (aged 18\u00a0years and older) with an ED diagnosis and a Body Mass index (BMI) of between 17.5 and 40 will be randomly allocated to the control or the intervention group. Subjects in the control group will receive Treatment as Usual (standard outpatient treatment provided at the participating sites). Subjects in the intervention group will receive 20 sessions of CBT-E in 20\u00a0weeks. The design is a 2 (group)\u2009\u00d7\u20095 (time) repeated measures factorial design in which neither therapists nor patients will be blinded for treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure is recovery from the ED. Secondary outcome measures include ED psychopathology, common mental disorders, anxiety and depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, health care use and productivity loss. Self-esteem, perfectionism and interpersonal problems will be examined as putative predictors and mediators of the effect of treatment. Also, an economic evaluation from a societal perspective will be undertaken. All relevant effects, direct and indirect costs will be included. Utility scores will measure the effects. Measurements will take place at pretreatment, 6\u00a0weeks, 20\u00a0weeks, 40\u00a0weeks and 80\u00a0weeks.DiscussionThis effectiveness study into CBT-E has the aim of broadening the scope and generalizability of former studies. If CBT-E appears to be at least as effective as traditional diagnosis-specific treatments for a broad range of ED patients, training in one protocol would be sufficient for clinicians to treat patients with different kinds of EDs. It gives the opportunity to offer treatment for a severe mental disorder with fewer resources, thereby increasing the accessibility of specialized care for patients with an ED.Trial registrationNetherlands Trial Register, NTR4485.

A novel application of the transdiagnostic approach for eating disorders (ED) was implemented. A mixed sample of 62 patients, 13 anorexia nervosa (AN) (21%); 29 bulimia nervosa (BN) (47%) and 20 eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS) (32%) were admitted to a CBT-E day treatment. Forty-seven patients (75.8%) completed the treatment as defined by completing two-thirds of treatment and the discharge assessment. A total of 31.9% (15/47) achieved recovery as defined by post-treatment body mass index (BMI)\u2009\u2265\u200918.5 and global Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) +1 SD above community mean. An increase of 1.2 BMI units (15.8\u201317.0, p\u2009<\u2009.02) was observed for very underweight patients (BMI\u2009<\u200917.5). Patients with BN showed significantly greater improvement than AN or EDNOS for ED symptomology, state anxiety and self-esteem. Findings demonstrated high treatment acceptability of the CBT-E day treatment programme and significant, yet differential, improvement across diagnostic groups.\n\n==\n\nHamadi 2021:\n\nTitle: Delivering CBT-E In an Online Group Format: A Pilot Study in a Child and Adolescent Eating Disorder Service\n\nAbstract: \n Background: The increased prevalence of eating disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic has placed services for children and adolescents under immense pressure. The high number of people at medical risk has led to longer waiting lists for psychological support for those who are physically stable. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of providing group enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy for eating disorders (CBT-E), in a virtual setting, as a way of increasing the provision of evidence-based treatment during the pandemic.Method: Clinicians in a child and adolescent eating disorder service were invited to refer patients to take part in a six-session course of therapy comprising the CBT-E Stage Three Body Image module. Primary outcomes were acceptance rates, completion rates, qualitative feedback and quantitative data from routine measures of eating disorder psychopathology and psychosocial impairment.Results: From 22 eligible referrals, 12 participants accepted and enrolled in therapy. Eight completed all six sessions. Qualitative feedback was positive. Both the content and group nature of the intervention were described as helpful. There was an improvement in all scores on the psychometric tests. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated that online group CBT-E was a feasible method of providing psychological therapy within the service. A larger trial is recommended to robustly test the effectiveness of the intervention compared to one-to-one in-person CBT-E, and to test whether other modules of the CBT-E protocol can be similarly delivered in this population.Trial registration: This study was pre-registered and approved as a clinical service evaluation by the Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom", "final_summary": "The research question at hand explores the effectiveness of more than 40 sessions of Enhanced Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT-E) for resistant patients with eating disorders. \n\nByrne (2011) and Signorini (2018) both reported significant improvements in eating disorder and general psychopathology among patients who completed 20-40 sessions of CBT-E. However, they also noted high dropout rates, with only 53% and 50% of patients completing treatment, respectively. Fairburn (2015) found that CBT-E led to remission in 69.4% of patients, outperforming interpersonal psychotherapy. \n\nFrostad (2018) implemented CBT-E in an outpatient setting and observed a significant increase in Body Mass Index (BMI) among patients who completed the treatment. However, half of the patients did not complete the treatment.

Using post-structuralistic theories of possibility spaces combined with neo-cybernetic mechanisms such as feedback allows to actively manipulate the phase space of possibilities. This is the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence and it is implementing mechanisms and setting up experiments with the goal of the creation of open-ended systems. It sidesteps the traditional argumentation of top-down versus bottom-up by using both mechanisms. Bottom-up procedures are used to generate possibility spaces and top-down methods sort out the structures that are functioning the worst.

Such technologies potentially introduce a massive disruption to creative fields. This paper presents the results of a qualitative survey (N = 23) investigating how creative professionals think about generative AI. The results show that the advancement of these AI models prompts important reflections on what defines creativity and how creatives imagine using AI to support their workflows.

The goal of a generative model is to study a collection of training examples and learn the probability distribution that generated them. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are then able to generate more examples from the estimated probability distribution. Generative models based on deep learning are common, but GANs are among the most successful generative models (especially in terms of their ability to generate realistic high-resolution images). GANs have been successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks (mostly in research settings) but continue to present unique challenges and research opportunities because they are based on game theory while most other approaches to generative modeling are based on optimization.\n\n==\n\nEpstein 2023:\n\nTitle: Art and the science of generative AI: A deeper dive\n\nAbstract: A new class of tools, colloquially called generative AI, can produce high-quality artistic media for visual arts, concept art, music, fiction, literature, video, and animation. The generative capabilities of these tools are likely to fundamentally alter the creative processes by which creators formulate ideas and put them into production. As creativity is reimagined, so too may be many sectors of society. Understanding the impact of generative AI - and making policy decisions around it - requires new interdisciplinary scientific inquiry into culture, economics, law, algorithms, and the interaction of technology and creativity. We argue that generative AI is not the harbinger of art's demise, but rather is a new medium with its own distinct affordances. In this vein, we consider the impacts of this new medium on creators across four themes: aesthetics and culture, legal questions of ownership and credit, the future of creative work, and impacts on the contemporary media ecosystem. Across these themes, we highlight key research questions and directions to inform policy and beneficial uses of the technology.\n\n==\n\nTzirides 2023:\n\nTitle: Generative AI: Implications and Applications for Education\n\nAbstract: The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 precipitated a panic among some educators while prompting qualified enthusiasm from others.

As a result, many individuals have become interested in related resources and are seeking to uncover the background and secrets behind its impressive performance. In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI) techniques belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), which involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music, and natural language, through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the content creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the production of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by extracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by human, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent information. In recent years, large-scale models have become increasingly important in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus, improved generation results. With the growth of data and the size of the models, the distribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer to reality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This survey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and basic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and multimodal interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the generation tasks and relative models of text and image.

In this study, the role of access to finance in driving innovations and productivity in Nigerian SMEs is investigated using the World Bank Enterprise Survey (ES) dataset. Innovation is defined based on the ES analysis using five compositions. The study considers finance in terms of source in meeting investment needs and in terms of access. Moreover, finance access is categorized as external and internal to a firm with each having different implications. The results from the empirical analysis shows that in general, access to finance drives firm innovation and productivity. In particular, ease of accessing bank loans and credit is shown to be the strongest positive force in driving all types of innovation among SMEs in Nigeria. In the same vein, the type of finance source for investment matters in terms of how it affects innovation: both internal and external sources improve investment in product, process and organizational innovation, but only external financing has effect on R&D spending and use of foreign licensed technology.

In the light of this, this paper provided functional solutions by examining developments, innovations and new financing windows available to MSMEs viz-a-viz Financial Technology that is capable of enhancing the goal of financial inclusion as a strategic tool of achieving sustainable development in the MSMEs sector in Nigeria. We classify the methodologies and approaches the researchers have adopted to predict the impact of Financial Technology on financial inclusion in respect to MSMEs financing in the South West States of Nigeria. We notice that MSMEs financing has the potential to be the fourth largest sector to be disrupted by Financial Technology in the next five years after consumer banking, payments and investment/wealth management in the financial sector. We identify that financial institutions need to collaborate and capitalize on the Financial Technology ecosystems by leveraging on artificial intelligence, big data, data analytics and MSMEs friendly applications in effectively lending to MSMEs sector. We observe that Financial Technology has the potential to drive financial inclusion, with high internet, electricity and mobile phone penetration more states will achieve the 20% financial exclusion target faster by the year 2020.

A total of 362 questionnaires from SMEs in North Western Nigeria were used in this study. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the study hypotheses. Using SmartPLS 3.0 the findings indicates that strategic orientations are important drivers of firm success to finance. The result further suggests that SMEs who configured and utilized their strategic activities are more likely to get more cash flow, profit and retained earnings and will obtain a loan from external sources. To get an adequate financial capital SMEs need to improve their marketing activities, learn more from their experience and environment and lastly produce product with high technological improvement.

The study conducted a survey of 120 Small and Medium Scale Enterprises across the four (4) identified geo-political zones in Lagos state. These SMEs with employment ranging from 2-10 employees in the fashion, educational, online merchants, pharmaceuticals, automobile, cosmetics, agro-allied, printing, bakery, eatery, I.T. firms and retail enterprises. This was done in such a way that the four axes were represented, each axis having thirty (30) SMEs. One hundred (100) Questionnaires were found useful for the purpose of the study representing 83% of the total questionnaire distributed. The data was analyzed using inferential statistics. The study reveals that Financial Technology (FinTech) has great impact on the economy, and therefore contributing positively to national development. It also discussed the benefits and risks of embracing and investing in FinTech. In order to remain sustainable and profitable in business in this 21st century, it was recommended that the financial authorities and government embark on massive campaign and support of emerging FinTech organizations as well as embracing FinTech in its operations. Also, the SMEs are highly recommended to adopt FinTech payment channels in their operations.\n\n==\n\nGbandi 2014:\n\nTitle: Financing Options for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria\n\nAbstract: Small and Medium enterprises act as catalysts in the economic development of the developed and developing countries. Developing countries like Nigeria that require sustained economic growth in their economies must pay attention to the SME sector and harness the great potential to generate employment, improved local technology, output diversification, developed indigenous entrepreneurship and forward integration with large-scale industries that can be provided by the sector. Unfortunately, the SMEs in Nigeria have underperformed despite the fact that the SMEs in Nigeria constitute more than 90% of Nigerian businesses, their contribution to the nation\u2019s GDP is below 10%. This very low percentage contribution of the SMEs to Nigeria\u2019s GDP could be attributed to amongst others; unfriendly business environment, poor funding, low management skills and lack of assess to modern technology. However, this paper focuses on adequate funding which will take care of some of the problems such as provision of modern technology and low managerial skills. It examines the financing of SMEs in Nigeria and the various financing options available to the SMEs. This involved looking at debt financing by considering the role commercial, microfinance banks, co-operatives and other finance institutions play in the financing of SMEs in Nigeria. It also considered the role of equity financing through Venture capital and Business angels financing. It concluded that funding of SMEs in Nigeria is very critical if they are to perform their role of growth and development of the nation\u2019s economy.", "final_summary": "The collective findings from the papers suggest that access to financial services significantly benefits SMEs in Nigeria, and by extension, the Nigerian economy. \n\nAdegboye (2018) and Oluwayemi (2020) both found that access to finance, particularly external sources such as bank loans, significantly drives innovation among SMEs.

In this work, we present properties of neural networks that complement this aspect of expressivity. By using tools from Fourier analysis, we show that deep ReLU networks are biased towards low frequency functions, meaning that they cannot have local fluctuations without affecting their global behavior. Intuitively, this property is in line with the observation that over-parameterized networks find simple patterns that generalize across data samples. We also investigate how the shape of the data manifold affects expressivity by showing evidence that learning high frequencies gets \\emph{easier} with increasing manifold complexity, and present a theoretical understanding of this behavior. Finally, we study the robustness of the frequency components with respect to parameter perturbation, to develop the intuition that the parameters must be finely tuned to express high frequency functions.\n\n==\n\nLazzari 2023:\n\nTitle: Understanding the Spectral Bias of Coordinate Based MLPs Via Training Dynamics\n\nAbstract: Spectral bias is an important observation of neural network training, stating that the network will learn a low frequency representation of the target function before converging to higher frequency components. This property is interesting due to its link to good generalization in over-parameterized networks. However, in low dimensional settings, a severe spectral bias occurs that obstructs convergence to high frequency components entirely. In order to overcome this limitation, one can encode the inputs using a high frequency sinusoidal encoding. Previous works attempted to explain this phenomenon using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) and Fourier analysis. However, NTK does not capture real network dynamics, and Fourier analysis only offers a global perspective on the network properties that induce this bias. In this paper, we provide a novel approach towards understanding spectral bias by directly studying ReLU MLP training dynamics. Specifically, we focus on the connection between the computations of ReLU networks (activation regions), and the speed of gradient descent convergence. We study these dynamics in relation to the spatial information of the signal to understand how they influence spectral bias. We then use this formulation to study the severity of spectral bias in low dimensional settings, and how positional encoding overcomes this.\n\n==\n\nYang 2022:\n\nTitle: Overcoming the Spectral Bias of Neural Value Approximation\n\nAbstract: Value approximation using deep neural networks is at the heart of off-policy deep reinforcement learning, and is often the primary module that provides learning signals to the rest of the algorithm. While multi-layer perceptron networks are universal function approximators, recent works in neural kernel regression suggest the presence of a spectral bias, where fitting high-frequency components of the value function requires exponentially more gradient update steps than the low-frequency ones. In this work, we re-examine off-policy reinforcement learning through the lens of kernel regression and propose to overcome such bias via a composite neural tangent kernel. With just a single line-change, our approach, the Fourier feature networks (FFN) produce state-of-the-art performance on challenging continuous control domains with only a fraction of the compute. Faster convergence and better off-policy stability also make it possible to remove the target network without suffering catastrophic divergences, which further reduces TD}(0)'s estimation bias on a few tasks.", "final_summary": "The spectral bias of neural networks, a fascinating phenomenon observed during their training, suggests that these networks are inclined towards learning less complex, low-frequency functions (Cao 2019, Cao 2021).

The pattern of the change in these two chloroplastic nitrogen fractions varied according to the leaf position. In order to find out the relationship between the change in the chloroplastic nitrogen fractions and the photosynthetic activity of a leaf, the rate of oxygen evolution of leaf sections on a total leaf nitrogen basia was also followed. The rate of oxygen evolution/total leaf nitrogen was affected by two factors. i.e., lamellae nitrogen/total leaf nitrogen and the lamellae-stroma composition of the chloroplast.

Maximum rates of oxygen evolution (coupled and uncoupled) were found when the plants were grown in 340 mol m\u22123 NaCl.

Oxygen evolution by the chloroplasts was measured under identical conditions for all treatments with saturating light and with dichloroindophenol as oxidant. Evolution was inhibited when leaf water potentials were below -12 bars in pea and -8 bars in sunflower and the inhibition was proportional to leaf water potential below these limits. Inhibition was more severe in sunflower than in pea chloroplasts. In sunflower, it could be detected after 5 minutes of leaf desiccation, and, up to 1 hour, the effect was independent of the duration of low leaf water potential.In high light, the reduction in activity of sunflower chloroplasts paralleled the reduction in CO(2) fixation by intact sunflower plants having low leaf water potentials. Stomatal apertures and transpiration rates were also reduced under these conditions and were probably limiting. In low light, intact sunflowers required more light per unit of CO(2) fixed when leaf water potentials were low than when they were high. This increased light requirement in the intact system was of a magnitude which could be predicted from the reduced oxygen evolution by the isolated chloroplasts. It was concluded that moderately low leaf water potential affects photosynthesis in at least two ways: first, through an inhibition of oxygen evolution by chloroplasts and, second, by closure of stomata in intact leaves.\n\n==\n\nArnason 1976:\n\nTitle: Studies on the rate-limiting reaction of photosynthetic oxygen evolution in spinach chloroplasts.\n\nAbstract: The modulated oxygen polarography has been used to study the rate-determining steps of photosynthetic oxygen evolution in spinach chloroplasts. The rate constant, k, of the reaction has a value of 218 +/- 10 (S.E.) s-1 at 23 degrees C and an activation energy of 7 +/- 2 (S.E.) kcal-mol-1. A kinetic isotope experiment indicated that this step is probably not the water-splitting reaction. These findings resemble previous results with the unicellular alga Chlorella (Sinclair, J. and Arnason, T (1974) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 368, 393-400). In other experiments we changed the pH, O2 concentration and osmolarity of the medium, and treated the chloroplasts with 1 mM NH4Cl without detecting any significant change in k.

Much of the injury to plants caused by stress exposure is associated with oxidative damage at the cellular level. Widespread losses of forests and crops due to ozone pollution provide a highly visible example of oxidative stress (see Tingey et al., 1993, for a review), but less obvious losses caused by oxidative damage associated with periods of cold or drought also take their toll in the accumulation of incremental setbacks during a growing season. The role of ROIs in plant stress damage is indicated by the increased production of ROIs and the increased oxidative damage in tissues during stress. In plants, the highly energetic reactions of photosynthesis and an abundant oxygen supply make the chloroplast a particularly rich source of ROIs. High light intensity can lead to excess reduction of PSI so that CO2 fixation cannot keep pace and NADP+ pools are reduced. Under these conditions, 02 can compete for electrons from PSI, leading to the generation of ROIs through the Mehler reaction. When CO2 fixation is limited by environmental conditions such as cold temperatures or low CO2 availability (closed stomata), excess PSI reduction and increased ROI production can occur even at moderate light intensities. Efficient removal of ROIs from chloroplasts is critical, since H202 concentrations as low as 10 ptM can inhibit photosynthesis by 50% (Kaiser, 1979). Although the toxicity of *?2and H202 themselves is relatively low, their metal-dependent conversion to the highly toxic -OH via the Haber-Weiss reaction is thought to be responsible for the majority of the biological damage associated with these molecules. Antioxidant systems of plant chloroplasts include enzymes such as SOD and APX, and nonenzymatic components such as ascorbic acid and glutathione. The proposed ROI scavenging pathway of chloroplasts is shown in Figure 1 (Asada, 1994). Superoxide radicals are produced by the reduction of molecular oxygen at PSI via the Mehler reaction. This ?2- is rapidly dismuted to H202 by SOD that is associated with the thylakoid. The H202 produced is\n\n==\n\nWalker 1976:\n\nTitle: Photosynthesis in a reconstituted chloroplast system from spinach. Some factors affecting CO2-dependent oxygen evolution with fructose-1,6-bisphosphate as substrate.\n\nAbstract: When envelope-free spinach chloroplasts are incubated with stromal protein, catalytic NADP, catalytic ADP, radioactive bicarbonate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 14CO2 fixation starts immediately upon illumination but oxygen evolution is delayed. The delay is increased by the addition of fructose 6-phosphate and by a variety of factors known (or believed) to increase fructose bisphosphatase activity (such as dithiothreitol, more alkaline pH, higher [Mg] and antimycin A). Conversely, the lag can be decreased or eliminated by the addition of an ATP-generating system. Bearing in mind the known inhibition, by ADP, of sn-phospho-3-glycerate (3-phosphoglycerate) reduction it is concluded that the lag in O2 evolution results from the production of ribulose 5-phosphate from fructose bisphosphate and that this in turn inhibits the reoxidation of NADPH by adversely affecting the ADP/ATP ratio. The results are discussed in their relation to the mode of action of antimycin A and to regulation of the reductive pentose phosphate pathway.\n\n==\n\nTOLMACH 1951:\n\nTitle: Effects of Triphosphopyridine Nucleotide upon Oxygen Evolution and Carbon Dioxide Fixation by Illuminated Chloroplasts\n\nAbstract: THE illumination of suspensions of chloroplasts always causes a very small and transient evolution of oxygen.

It was also Utopia in power and a prison of the peoples (sentenced to life without parole or death through eventual fusion). But was it a modern colonial empire? Does it belong on the same trash heap as the Dutch, French, and British imperial states that consisted of a national core and overseas dependencies? Paula Michaels seems to think that it does, but does not explain why. Her essay describes the Soviet cleansing of Kazakh persons and practices, the \"subjugation of Kazakh bodies to state medical authority,\" and the denigration of \"traditional Kazakh social, cultural, and economic structures\" by a state that \"knew better than Kazakhs themselves how to care for their physical selves, their domiciles, and their villages.\" Since this sounds very much like the progress and health care that Foucault would bemoan and most modern states would promote, the question is whether there was anything specifically colonial or specifically Soviet about the way the campaign was conducted. On the colonial score, Michaels argues her case indirectly, by suggesting that the attempt by the modernizing Soviet state to civilize its citizens was also a \"Russian effort to reshape Kazakhs in their own image,\" a crosscultural encounter between \"Russian civilization\" and Kazakh life. One could quibble that the anonymous doctor from the essay's opening lines might have been just as likely to pine for the Belorussian marshes, Caucasian peaks, or Ukrainian steppes as for the \"dense birch forests\" of Central Russia, or that the sinister-named agents of Russian cleanliness Minlos and Akodus were ably assisted by Nurpeisov, Tleugabylov, and Salim, but the general point seems valid and potentially very productive. Michaels does not pursue it, however, stating elsewhere that \"the experiences of Kazakhstan and Central Asia mirror that of other regions, including rural Russia.\" This weakens her argument somewhat, it seems to me-for if medical authorities used the same \"tools of empire\" to sanitize Kazakh nomads and Slavic peasants, then what is the utility of ''colonial empire\" as a comparative framework? One way to answer this question is to argue that mutual perceptions are as good a gauge of colonialism as the behavior of the medical missionaries or the shape of the state that bred them. Would Minlos and Akodus have described Tambov backwardness differently? Did most Kazakhs regard the alien healers as \"Russian\"? Would a \"yes\" on both counts strengthen the colonial argument? I expect so, but I would like to see more evidence.\n\n==\n\n\u0415\u043a\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043a 2015:\n\nTitle: \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d: \u041a\u0430\u043a \u041e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u041d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0435 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u044b \u0432 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u042d\u043f\u043e\u0445\u0443\n\nAbstract: SUMMARY: Serhy Yekelchyk\u2019s article proceeds from the assumption that an imperial state creates room for the articulation of ethnic difference rather than pursues some kind of an assimilationist project. Moreover, the imperial rule necessitates the development of homogenizing and essentializing devices such as \u201cIndia\u201d or \u201cUkraine\u201d that are useful both for the imperial definitions of what or who is being ruled and for the indigenous elites. The author argues that understanding Stalinist historical memory as a subspecies of an imperial discourse allows us to make sense of the hierarchy of many national pasts within it. Moreover, such an approach also throws some new light on the question of agency in the Stalinist cultural production. In the article, bureaucrats and intellectuals in the republics who interpreted the vague yet powerful signals from the Kremlin emerge as major players in the shaping of the Stalinist historical imagination. In his assessment of the role of this social group, Yekelchyk relies on the insights from post-colonial theory, which, in his view, is particularly helpful for making sense of the limits and possibilities in the promotion of non-Russian historical memory under Stalinism. Yekelchyk shows that the Stalinist project of memory was disadvantaged from the beginning by the state\u2019s inability to control individual interpretations of historical narratives. But this was not its only problem. When in the 1930s the Stalinist USSR became the self-conscious successor of the Russian Empire, it had to incorporate into its narrative the story of tsarist conquests and territorial acquisitions. However, it never quite reconciled this narrative with the previous notion of \u201cclass history\u201d or with the separate historical mythologies of the non-Russian peoples. In addition, residual counter-memories of the pre-Bolshevik nationalist historical narratives survived in Ukraine well after World War II. The German occupation further undermined the Soviet authorities\u2019 control over public memory. The Kremlin sought to prescribe and homogenize social memory, but internal tensions within the Stalinist historical narrative and their inability to prescribe only one possible reading of cultural products undermined their efforts. The authorities could not fix the meaning of the past, from which the Soviet nations supposedly got their sense of orientation for the future. In the end, the Stalinist empire of memory was kept together by state intimidation \u2013 and began disintegrating as soon as the threat of political violence was removed. Yekelchyk develops these arguments in the sections of the article dedicated to the post-war pantheon of \u201cUkrainian classics\u201d, Sovietization of Ukranian museums and the mnemo-projects of monuments and memorials.\n\n==\n\nGrachev 2022:\n\nTitle: The Soviet Union as an Empire: On the Issue of the Political and Legal Nature of the Territorial Structure of the USSR\n\nAbstract: Introduction: despite the fact that the modern Russian Federation is the legal successor of the USSR and historically has grown out of it, the necessary theoretical analysis of the Soviet statehood does not occur in modern social sciences. This also applies to the problem of the political and territorial structure of the Soviet Union, about the form of which there is a significant range of opinions in the literature, often diametrically opposed. The subject of the paper is to find the most accurate methods of studying the nature of the territorial organization of the Soviet state, and its purpose is to determine on this basis an adequate state form of the USSR. Methods: the methodological framework for the work is a set of methods of scientific cognition, among which the dialectical and historical-legal methods and the civilizational approach are of key importance in the systematic analysis of the basic conditions of education and trends in the evolution of the Soviet statehood. The results of the study show that when searching for the optimal model of the state form, especially in a revolutionary situation, it is impossible to dogmatically oppose democracy to dictatorship, unitarianism to federalism, centralization to autonomy, etc., which was well demonstrated by the leadership of the Bolshevik Party by creating an updated version of the giant Eurasian (Russian) continental empire of the socialist type. Conclusions: the Soviet Union possessed a sufficient set of political and legal features that allow it to be attributed to empires. Therefore, looking in many external parameters as a historical break with the St. Petersburg Empire, the Soviet state that replaced it, from the point of view of the logic of Russian history and its political and legal content, was a necessary link in the evolution of the Russian statehood, representing a completely natural phase of its development and having at its core an imperial geopolitical nature, genetically characteristic of the Russian civilization.\n\n==\n\nRieber 1994:\n\nTitle: Russian Imperialism: Popular, Emblematic, Ambiguous\n\nAbstract: T hese three richly suggestive essays give strong and hopeful promise that future studies of Russian imperialism will be informed as much by culture as by diplomatic and military history. By their substance and eloquence they challenge the traditional reliance on geopolitics as the dominant explanatory model of Russian foreign policy. At the very least they contribute to the modest body of scholarly literature that proposes \"geoculture\" as an alternative way of analyzing the dramatic expansion and the no less dramatic contraction of the Russian state over the past five centuries. In addition, they explore and contrast two dimensions of imperialism, the universalistor European-and the particularist-or Russian. Finally, they remind us of the importance of making analytical distinctions between the self-perception of the imperialists and the critical perception of the scholar. The overall effect, subtle but compelling, is to question once again the hoary dualism of Westernizer and Slavophile as a useful intellectual framework in which to compose cultural history. In every modern state imperialism shares a commonality of motives: the search for markets and raw materials, the assumption of greator world-power status, the consolidation of real or imagined security interests and the fulfillment of a national mission. But in each case the definition of the national mission must differ, reflecting the peculiarities of the dominant culture of the metropolitan center. Manifest destiny, the white man's burden, la mission civilisatrice, the contest between Kultur and Zivilization-yes, and even the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere-were so many forms of shorthand, slogans, to legitimize continental and overseas expansion, simplified like all shorthand, but capturing essentials of the real phenomenon. Russia lacked a popular and catchy phrase to capture the essence of its imperialism. Pushkin's narodnost' might have worked if the term had not been expropriated and vulgarized by Uvarov and Nicholas I. But this absence of a defining term should not blind us, as these essays demonstrate, to the complex cultural traits that informed Russian expansion. Modern Russian imperialism was no more or less particularist than that of the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany or Japan. It was cast in a different cultural mold; the problem is to explain the difference.\n\n==\n\nShamakhov 2021:\n\nTitle: Why the Reasons for the Collapse of the USSR Should Be Sought Before the Formation of the USSR. Article Two. The Strategic Error of Soviet Federalization as a Reflection on the Imperial Structure\n\nAbstract: After the victory in the civil war, the question of the organization of power arose not only in the political, but also in the territorial-political sphere. For a long time, the Bolsheviks positioned the empire as a \u201cprison of peoples\u201d. After 1920 (Crimea), an adequate answer was needed from the authorities. The old party slogan influenced constitutional construction, and, to the Gorbachev era, the country came with the \u201csleeping norm\u201d of the right to leave the Union Republic from the USSR. \u043a \u043d\u0435\u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c-\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043c\u00bb.

A century ago, European countries and their rulers welcomed the term. It implied not only that a country was powerful but also, probably, that it was in the forefront of progress, one of that very small group of great powers entrusted, in Hegelian terms, with leading mankind towards higher levels of culture, wealth and freedom. Flattering comparisons were made with the great civilizations of the past, almost all of them embodied in political terms in empires. In the late twentieth century, however, empire implies exploitation of weak communities by stronger ones, as well, particularly, as the suppression of the Third World by Western power and culture. Empire is seen, moreover, not merely as wicked but also as anachronistic and doomed to disappear. In the post-1945 global economy, autarchy and physical control of territory are viewed as largely irrelevant: peaceful access to food, raw materials and markets seems assured, and the skills, unity and motivation of a country's workforce are regarded as the keys to prosperity and even power. Countries are unwilling to take upon themselves\n\n==\n\nRisch 2015:\n\nTitle: A Soviet West: nationhood, regionalism, and empire in the annexed western borderlands\n\nAbstract: This article considers the role the Soviet Union's western borderlands annexed during World War II played in the evolution of Soviet politics of empire. Using the Baltic Republics and Western Ukraine as case studies, it argues that Sovietization had a profound impact on these borderlands, integrating them into a larger Soviet polity. However, guerrilla warfare and Soviet policy-making indirectly led to these regions becoming perceived as more Western and nationalist than other parts of the Soviet Union. The Baltic Republics and Western Ukraine differed in their engagement with the Western capitalist world. Different experiences of World War II and late Stalinism and contacts with the West ultimately led to this region becoming Soviet, yet different from the rest of the Soviet Union. While the Soviet West was far from uniform, perceived differences between it and the rest of the Soviet Union justified claims at the end of the 1980s that the Soviet Union was an empire rather than a family of nations.\n\n==\n\nMartin 2001:\n\nTitle: The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939\n\nAbstract: The Soviet Union was the first of Europe's multiethnic states to confront the rising tide of nationalism by systematically promoting the national consciousness of its ethnic minorities and establishing for them many of the institutional forms characteristic of the modern nation-state. In the 1920s, the Bolshevik government, seeking to defuse nationalist sentiment, created tens of thousands of national territories. It trained new national leaders, established national languages, and financed the production of national-language cultural products.This was a massive and fascinating historical experiment in governing a multiethnic state. Terry Martin provides a comprehensive survey and interpretation, based on newly available archival sources, of the Soviet management of the nationalities question. He traces the conflicts and tensions created by the geographic definition of national territories, the establishment of dozens of official national languages, and the world's first mass \"affirmative action\" programs. Martin examines the contradictions inherent in the Soviet nationality policy, which sought simultaneously to foster the growth of national consciousness among its minority populations while dictating the exact content of their cultures; to sponsor national liberation movements in neighboring countries, while eliminating all foreign influence on the Soviet Union's many diaspora nationalities. Martin explores the political logic of Stalin's policies as he responded to a perceived threat to Soviet unity in the 1930s by re-establishing the Russians as the state's leading nationality and deporting numerous \"enemy nations.\"", "final_summary": "The papers collectively provide a nuanced understanding of why the USSR was an imperialist state.

As a result of this effort, the industrial engineering department is responsible for designing an integrated economics/engineering economy course to be taught at the freshman level. In keeping with the school\u2019s philosophy of an integrated curriculum, the course also emphasizes students\u2019 computer and communication skills. To teach such an integrated course, especially at the freshman level, we needed to redesign our traditional engineering economy course. We decided to incorporate collaborative learning strategies into our revised course; thus, the course features a mix of traditional lectures and group learning assignments. This paper describes the development of this new course . INTRODUCTION As part of the redesigned engineering core curriculum, the engineering economics course, traditionally taught at the junior level, has become a part of the freshman year curriculum. Furthermore, the microeconomics that had been a separate quarter-long required course taught by the business school has been integrated into the new semester-long course. These two changes in the engineering curriculum have led to the need to seriously reexamine the way the engineering economics course is taught. We have made three major changes to the course structure. First, the new course is team-taught. Business school faculty teach the microeconomics portion and engineering school faculty teach the engineering economy portion. Second, the new semester-long course deals with subject matter previously included in two quarter-long courses; therefore we eliminated some topics that were included in the original courses. Third, we designed the new course around the needs of the typical college freshman. Many freshmen have not yet learned the benefits of studying together as a group. Unlike juniors, freshman students are typically still developing their time management and study habit skills. We believe that designing the course based on collaborative learning principles will increase the students\u2019 chances for success. Studies conducted over a number of years have shown that the cooperative learning approach is very effective in a wide variety of educational environments. 1 A recent Prism article 2 describes the following benefits of cooperative learning at the higher education level: \u2022 Higher levels of achievement \u2022 Greater level of academic self-esteem \u2022 Creation of more sophisticated solutions to complex problems \u2022 More positive relationships P ge 309.1 Two recent books discuss general ways to apply collaborative learning principles in the engineering classroom. 3,4 In addition, several authors have written articles which describe the use of collaborative learning principles in specific engineering courses. Felder\u2019s 5 articles detail his successful experiences over a number of years. Yokomoto and Ware 6 present data on the effective use of group quizzes in a sophomore level electronics course. Sears 7 gives a detailed description of the implementation of collaborative learning in a freshman level electronics class. Jones and Brickner 8 report on the use of cooperative learning in a large-enrollment statics class; Howell 9 gives a detailed description of the implementation of cooperative learning in a dynamics class. However, there is some indication that a number of faculty members have not yet incorporated these active learning and group techniques in their engineering economy classrooms. In a recent survey, 10 fewer than half of the respondents indicated that they use groups (formal or informal) in their engineering economy classes. On the other hand, many of us have used some collaborative learning techniques in the engineering economy classroom and would like to spend time developing more such exercises. Since the literature indicates that the potential benefits of teaching in a cooperative learning environment are worth the substantial time investment, we will use these techniques extensively in our new course. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN Having decided to use cooperative techniques in this course, we needed an implementation plan; we adopted a three-phase implementation procedure. Phase I Develop a departmental library of collaborative learning books and articles Motivate other instructors as to benefits of collaborative learning Incorporate collaborative learning principles into the basic course structure Prepare collaborative learning exercises for a small number of classes Develop preliminary assessment/feedback forms for students and faculty Develop a long-term assessment plan Initiate documentation procedures Explore possible funding sources for curricular development\n\n==\n\nGrasman 2002:\n\nTitle: Teaching Engineering Economics Via Distance Education\n\nAbstract: Driven by demand for distance education, the instructor lecturing to a room of students is replaced by a \u201cvirtual classroom\u201d.

This paper outlines demonstrated challenges with learning and teaching via streaming video over the internet as they relate to teaching a technical class such as engineering economics. Effective communication both in and out of the classroom is discussed, along with administrative issues such as remote submittal of assignments and administration of exams.

This research therefore investigated the quality of flour produced from fonio (Digitaria iburua) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) blend. Fonio and pigeon pea flour blends (100:0, 95:5, 90:10, 85:15 and 80:20 of fonio to pigeon pea) were analyzed for proximate, vitamin, mineral elements and amino acids. The flour blend with highest level of fiber, protein, ash and some essential amino acids (80:20 fonio to pigeon pea) and 100% fonio were developed into breakfast food and sensory attributes such as colour, taste, flavour and overall acceptability were evaluated. The results obtained were moisture (6.74\u20137.78%), protein (12.19\u201324.85%), fat (0.98\u20131.25%), crude fibre (1.03\u20131.20%), ash (0.58\u20131.03%), carbohydrates (63.69\u201377.77%) and energy (363.09\u2013371.53 kcal/100 g). Eighteen amino acids comprising essential and non essential amino acids were identified in the flour samples. The essential amino acids were phenylalanine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan and valine. Vitamins identified in the samples were A, B1, B2, B5, B6, B9, C, D, E and K. Significant amount of mineral elements were also recorded. The result of this study revealed that substitution of fonio grain with pigeon pea increased the protein, ash, some amino acids and vitamins of the flour blends. Sensory evaluation of all the attributes of the breakfast food ranked above like-moderately on the 9-point hedonic scale. The flour mixes can be used in the production of breakfast food.\n\n==\n\nHager 2012:\n\nTitle: Nutritional properties and ultra-structure of commercial gluten free flours from different botanical sources compared to wheat flours\n\nAbstract: Coeliac patients suffer from an immune mediated disease, triggered by the ingestion of a protein composite (gluten) found in wheat, rye and barley. Consequently, there is a need for products such as bread or pasta, made from alternative cereal grains or pseudocereals. A fair proportion of the gluten free products currently on the market are nutritionally inadequate. Hence, it was the aim of this study to investigate the nutrient composition of seven commonly used commercial gluten free flours (oat, rice, sorghum, maize, teff, buckwheat and quinoa) and compare them to wheat and wholemeal wheat flour. In addition to the levels of all major compounds, also mineral composition, fatty acid profile, phytate, polyphenols and folate content were determined. Furthermore, properties of carbohydrates were studied in greater detail, looking at total and damaged starch levels; total, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre content as well as amylose/amylopectin ratio. Proteins were further investigated by means of capillary electrophoreses. Additionally, the ultra-structure of these materials was explored using scanning electron microscopy. The results show that maize and rice flour are poor regarding their nutritional value (low protein, fibre, folate contents). In contrast, teff as well as the pseudocereals quinoa and buckwheat show a favourable fatty acid composition and are high in protein and folate. In particular, quinoa and teff are characterised by high fibre content and are high in calcium, magnesium and iron. Therefore these flours represent nutrient-dense raw materials for the production of gluten free foods.\n\n==\n\nCule\u021bu 2021:\n\nTitle: Nutritional and Functional Properties of Gluten-Free Flours\n\nAbstract: This study characterized and compared 13 gluten-free (GF) flours (rice, brown rice, maize, oat, millet, teff, amaranth, buckwheat, quinoa, chickpea, gram, tiger nut, and plantain) for their nutritional and functional properties. For all GF flours investigated, starch was the major component, except for gram, chickpea, and tiger nut flours with lower starch content (<45%), but higher fiber content (8.8\u201335.4%). The higher amount of calcium, magnesium, zinc, potassium, phosphorus, similar values for iron and lower content of sodium in gram, makes this flour a good alternative to chickpea or other GF flour to develop healthier food products. Amaranth flour had a high protein digestibility, while tiger nut and millet flours were less digestible. Gram, chickpea, quinoa, buckwheat, and oat flours fulfilled amino acids recommendation for daily adult intake showing no limiting amino acid. Total polyphenolic content and antioxidant capacity showed higher values for buckwheat, followed by quinoa and maize flours. Gram, chickpea, maize, and quinoa flours are good candidates to improve health conditions due to lower saturated fatty acid content. The findings of this study provide useful insights into GF flours and may contribute to the development of novel gluten-free products like bread, cookies, or pasta.\n\n==\n\nKadam 2011:\n\nTitle: Development and evaluation of composite flour for missi roti/chapatti.\n\nAbstract: The present research work on development and evaluation of composite flour for missi roti / chapati were carried out to develop the nutritious flours from various food commodities (wheat flour, chickpea, and soybean and methi leaves powder) to make good quality of chapaties. Four types of bends were acceptable. They were made from wheat flour, chickpea, full fat soy flour and methi powder in different ratio viz; \u2018A\u2019 wheat flour: chickpea flour (80:20). \u2018B\u2019 wheat flour: fullfat soy flour (90:10) \u2018C\u2019 wheat flour: chickpea flour: soy flour (80:10:10) and \u2018D\u2019 wheat flour: chickpea flour: soy flour: methi leaves powder (75: 10: 10: 05). The proximate composition of blends used for preparation of various products contained higher amount of protein and other nutrients. They contained proteins (11.8 to 15.37%), fat (1.53 to 3.45%), fibre (1.24 to 2.05%), ash (2.08 to 2.70%) and carbohydrates (65.99 to 74.2%). These results showed that soy flour / chickpea flour alone or in combination, both increased the amount of protein significantly. Calcium, phosphorus and iron were found to increase on supplementation of chickpea, soy flour and methi powder. Iron was high in methi supplemented blend. All these blended flours were found to have good sensory quality characteristics of products as control. All these blended flours could be well stored in polyethylene bags or tin boxes for the period of 3 months without any deterioration of quality. The supplementation of 5% methi powder increased the nutritional quality of flour particularly in minerals (calcium and iron) and fibres.\n\n==\n\nSaeid 2015:\n\nTitle: Comparative studies on nutritional quality of commercial wheat flour in Bangladesh\n\nAbstract: Cereal industry and its derived products have a large economic and social importance worldwide.

The entire brand had moisture contents: 9.90-12.48%, protein: 8.67-12.47%, fat: 0.893-1.387% and ash content: 0.387-0.707%. The ACI brand had the highest amount of protein of 12.47% whereas Romoni brand had highest fat of 1.387%, fiber: 0.26%, gluten content: 15.34% and water absorption index of 1.9 g/g as compared to other brands. In addition, sodium and calcium content were higher in ACI brand whereas potassium content was higher in Romoni brand. Results showed that wheat flour from all brand could be used to make various type of baked products. Bangladesh J. Sci. Ind.

Obtained results showed that organic samples had significantly lower protein content and lower levels of Ca, Mn and Fe compared to conventional samples. Protein digestibility and levels of K, Zn and Mo were significantly higher in organic than in conventional wheat flours. Regarding undesirable metals, significantly higher levels of As and Cd were found in conventional compared to organic wheat flours. Although the mean concentrations of zearalenone and ochratoxin A were higher in conventional than in organic flours, this difference was not significant. This study revealed that organic agriculture has the potential to yield products with some relevant improvements in terms of high quality proteins and microelements contents, while the reduction in contamination with toxic elements and mycotoxins may be accomplished.\n\n==\n\nPatil 2017:\n\nTitle: Nutritional, functional, phytochemical and structural characterization of gluten-free flours\n\nAbstract: Different gluten-free flours from various sources may vary in composition and properties, thereby affecting applications in food systems. Various gluten-free flours viz. sorghum, rice, moong, water chestnut flour (WCF) and unripe banana flour (UBF) were studied in comparison with wheat flour. These were studied for their proximate composition, pH, iodine affinity value, leaching, functional properties, phytochemical analysis, color analysis, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Protein content in these flours ranged from 5.31 to 24.07%moong flour having highest protein content. Variations were observed with fat percentage from 1.01 to 3.45%. All flours were high in carbohydrate content i.e. ranged between 61.63 to 81.19%. pH values indicated slight acidic nature of all flours. UBF was found to have maximum iodine affinity value (46086\u00a0ppm). Leaching study indicated the extent of leaching with respect to time in these flours. Light transmittance was decreased with the duration of cooking for all flours. Color analysis values showed the difference in the L*, a, b values. X-ray diffractograms revealed the crystallinity patterns of the flours with percentage crystallinity which ranged from 22.6 to 34.9.This study concludes that wheat can be substituted by these flours in various applications.\n\n==\n\nFraser 1958:\n\nTitle: Flour survey 1950\u201356\n\nAbstract: Flour examination has been regularly carried out by the Department of the Government Chemist since 1946 on behalf of the Ministry of Food and other government departments. The records show the changes in the nutritive value of the flour supplied for home consumption since the war, taking the desiderata of the Post-War Loaf Conference (1945) as the basis for comparison. The concurrence of vitamins of the B group is discussed with particular reference to the manner in which the production of the flour by the divides process simulated straight-run flour of the required extraction rate. The extent of variation of the amounts of nutrients is discussed and artificial additions of material are shown to have a marked influence.", "final_summary": "The nutritional composition and labeling of flour have been extensively studied, with a focus on both traditional wheat flour and alternative gluten-free flours. \n\nBabarinde (2020) found that blending fonio grain with pigeon pea increased the protein, ash, some amino acids, and vitamins of the flour blends, suggesting that such blends could be used to produce nutritious breakfast foods. Similarly, Hager (2012) found that teff, quinoa, and buckwheat flours were nutrient-dense, with high protein, fiber, and folate content, and a favorable fatty acid composition. \n\nCule\u021bu (2021) also highlighted the nutritional benefits of gluten-free flours, particularly gram flour, which had a lower starch content but higher fiber content, and was rich in calcium, magnesium, zinc, potassium, and phosphorus. Kadam (2011) found that blending wheat flour with chickpea, soy flour, and methi leaves powder increased the protein, calcium, phosphorus, and iron content of the flour, making it a nutritious option for making chapatis.\n\nSaeid (2015) compared the nutritional quality of different commercial wheat flours in Bangladesh, finding variations in protein, fat, fiber, and ash content, as well as in mineral content. Vr\u010dek (2014) compared the nutritional value of organically and conventionally produced wheat flours, finding that organic flours had lower protein content and lower levels of Ca, Mn, and Fe, but higher levels of K, Zn, and Mo, and lower levels of undesirable metals such as As and Cd.\n\nPatil (2017) characterized various gluten-free flours, finding variations in their proximate composition, pH, iodine affinity value, leaching, functional properties, phytochemical analysis, color analysis, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Fraser (1958) provided a historical perspective, discussing changes in the nutritive value of flour supplied for home consumption since the war.\n\nIn conclusion, the nutritional composition of flour can vary greatly depending on the type of grain used and the processing methods. Both traditional wheat flour and alternative gluten-free flours can be nutrient-dense, but the specific nutrients they provide can vary. Therefore, it is important to consider the nutritional composition when choosing a flour for a specific dietary need or preference."}, {"query": "NEED FOR INSTITUTIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH JOURNALS", "paper_list_string": "Mufti 2015:\n\nTitle: NEED FOR INSTITUTIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH JOURNALS\n\nAbstract: Research publications in Pakistan have grown by 54% from year 2008 to 2012.\u00a0Because of increased research interest related to increased postgraduate programs in medical universities, the pressure on existing medical journals has also grown leading to long waiting queues for publication.

The spiralling cost of journals threatens the ability of libraries to provide their users' information needs. In this study the availability of a representative sample of journals used by South African biomedical researchers was determined at each of the seven medical faculty libraries. The application of a standardised document delivery test is described and the results are interpreted in terms of: (i) the capability index, which includes material obtainable through inter-library loans; and (ii) an availability index, or measure of the probability that a user will find an item without delay in his/her own library. The current status of availability of biomedical journals was found to be high at all the libraries; indeed, the scores compare favourably with results obtained at academic libraries overseas. There is, however, real concern that the financial crisis in tertiary education will cause the situation to deteriorate. Repetition of this test is recommended to monitor the (probably declining) level of journal availability. The information would support efforts to rationalise and subsequently strengthen academic medical libraries' collective holdings as a strategic national resource.\n\n==\n\nAminpour 2012:\n\nTitle: The influence of Iranian scientific journals in disseminating medical information\n\nAbstract: Background: Scientific journals are the most credible and updated information resources for valid information in the various fields of science and technology.

Materials and Methods: Total 163 Iranian medical journals accredited by national medical journals commission of Iranian ministry of health and medical education were evaluated through a cross-sectional study. The results were represented in descriptive statistics in the form of table and chart. Results: The study showed that 89.6% of Iranian medical journals were covered by regional information databases. Web of Science database indexed 22 (13.5%) Iranian journals in the field of medical science. Only six (6.7%) journals were indexed by Medline. Fifty-eight (35.6%) journals were in English, 102 (62.6%) in Persian, and three (1.8%) were bilingual which published their articles both in Persian and English languages.

Immunotoxin (IT) that targets the tumor cell surface receptor is a new supplementary therapeutic treatment approach. The purpose of this study is to detect the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in neuroblastoma cell lines and tissues, and to explore if IT therapy can be used to treat refractory neuroblastoma. The EGFR expression in human neuroblastoma tissue samples was detected by immunohistochemistry\u00a0staining. The positive rate of EGFR expression was 81.0% in neuroblastoma tissue and 50.0% in gangliocytoma, respectively, but without statistical significance between them (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The positive rate of EGFR expression in favorable type and unfavorable type was 62.5% and 92.3%, respectively, but they were not statistically different (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Results from pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy samples showed that there was no significant statistical difference (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05) between them in the EGFR expression. Furthermore, the EGFR expression levels in five neuroblastoma cell lines were measured using cell-based ELISA assay and western blot analysis. The results showed that the expression of EGFR was higher in KP-N-NS and BE(2)-C than those in other cell lines. Our results revealed that there are consistent and widespread expressions of EGFR in neuroblastoma tissues as well as in neuroblastoma cell lines, suggesting that it is possible to develop future treatment strategies of neuroblastoma by targeting at the EGFR.\n\n==\n\nTakehana 2003:\n\nTitle: Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor in gastric carcinomas.\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND & AIMS\nEpidermal growth factor receptor belongs to the family of type I receptor tyrosine kinases. Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor has been observed in a variety of cancers with or without amplification of the gene. Novel chemotherapies targeting receptor tyrosine kinases might be effective for the treatment of cancers in which overexpression of this protein is a feature. The aim of this study was to assess the potential efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy in gastric cancer. This was achieved by determining the frequency of increased epidermal growth factor receptor expression in gastric cancers and investigating the relationship between protein overexpression and gene amplification.\n\n\nMETHODS\nImmunohistochemical evaluation of 413 gastric cancers was carried out by using a monoclonal antibody to the epidermal growth factor receptor. The intensity of reactivity was scored by using a 4-tier system (negative, 1+, 2+, and 3+). All positive staining (>1+) tumors overexpressing the protein were then analyzed for gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization by using a gene-specific probe.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHigh levels of overexpression (2+ or 3+ staining) were found in 9 of 413 (2.2%) patients, whereas low levels of overexpression (1+) were found in 34 (8.2%) of the study cohort. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed that more than 10 copies of the gene were recognized in all 5 cancers with 3+ staining and in 2 of the 4 tumors with 2+ staining.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough a high level of overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor is uncommon in gastric carcinomas, it almost exclusively occurs by gene amplification.\n\n==\n\nItakura 1994:\n\nTitle: Epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression in esophageal carcinoma.

Results were correlated to clinical data.ResultsEGFR overexpression was found in 30/60\u00a0% of ependymomas depending on the antibody used and was more pronounced in WHO grade III. High EGFR gene copy number gains were found in 6 (11\u00a0%) ependymomas with half of them being amplifications. EGFR amplified ependymomas displayed an EGFR overexpression with both antibodies in two of three cases. A missense mutation in exon 20 of EGFR (S768I) was detected in one amplified case.ConclusionsEGFR is frequently overexpressed in ependymomas. Other mechanisms than amplification of the EGFR gene appear to contribute to EGFR overexpression in most cases. EGFR mutations may be present in a small subset of ependymomas.\n\n==\n\nKhalifa 1994:\n\nTitle: Prognostic utility of epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression in endometrial adenocarcinoma\n\nAbstract: Background.

On normal gastric mucosae, only parietal cells showed positive staining. On cancer tissues, definite staining was observed in 9 of 15 cases. Their staining intensities were variable and weaker in general compared to those of either gastric parietal cells or normal tonsilar squamous epithelium. No apparent correlation of EGF receptor staining with the grade of histologic differentiation or lymph node metastases of these gastric carcinomas was noted.\n\n==\n\nKalyankrishna 2006:\n\nTitle: Epidermal growth factor receptor biology in head and neck cancer.\n\nAbstract: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in several epithelial malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), which exhibits EGFR overexpression in up to 90% of tumors. EGFR ligands such as transforming growth factor alpha are also overexpressed in HNSCC. EGFR plays a critical role in HNSCC growth, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. However, EGFR inhibitors as monotherapy have yielded only modest clinical outcomes. Potential mechanisms for lack of response to EGFR inhibition in HNSCC include constitutive activation of signaling pathways independent of EGFR, as well as genetic aberrations causing dysregulation of the cell cycle. EGFR-directed therapy may be optimized by identifying and selecting those HNSCC patients most likely to benefit from EGFR inhibition. Resistance to EGFR inhibition may be circumvented by combination therapy employing EGFR inhibitors together with other treatment modalities.\n\n==\n\nGroves 1992:\n\nTitle: Abnormal expression of epidermal growth factor receptor in cutaneous epithelial tumours\n\nAbstract: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF\u03b1) are important keratinocyte mitogens. Their effects are mediated by a cell membrane receptor (EGFR), quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of which may be responsible for deranged keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. We have therefore examined EGFR expression immunohistochemically in a variety of benign and malignant epithelial neoplasms using monoclonal antibodies to the extracellular and intracellular receptor domains. In benign tumours (virus wart, seborrhoeic keratosis, keratoacanthoma), there was an ordered pattern of EGFR expression. In malignant tumours (basal and squamous cell carcinoma), there was loss of membrane labelling and cytoplasmic accumulation of the receptor. In premalignant proliferations, there was loss of membrane receptor with either absent cytoplasmic EGFR (actinic keratosis) or cytoplasmic receptor accumulation (Bowen's disease). Evidence of truncated receptors was not found. We suggest that dysregulation of the EGFR may be important in the development of cutaneous epithelial malignancies but that grossly abnormal forms of the receptor do not occur.", "final_summary": "The research question at hand explores the overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) in abdominal malignancies. The collected papers provide a comprehensive insight into this topic.\n\nZheng (2016) found that EGFR is consistently and widely expressed in neuroblastoma tissues and cell lines, suggesting potential for future treatment strategies targeting EGFR. Similarly, Takehana (2003) reported that although high-level overexpression of EGFR is uncommon in gastric carcinomas, when it does occur, it is almost exclusively due to gene amplification. Itakura (1994) and Khalifa (1994) both noted the overexpression of EGFR in esophageal carcinoma and endometrial adenocarcinoma respectively, but did not provide further details. \n\nFriedrich (2015) found EGFR overexpression in 30-60% of ependymomas, depending on the antibody used, and suggested that mechanisms other than EGFR gene amplification contribute to this overexpression. Sakai (1986) observed definite but variable EGFR staining in 9 out of 15 gastric carcinoma cases, with no apparent correlation with histologic differentiation or lymph node metastases. \n\nKalyankrishna (2006) reported EGFR overexpression in up to 90% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors. Groves (1992) found abnormal EGFR expression in various cutaneous epithelial tumors, with loss of membrane labeling and cytoplasmic accumulation of the receptor in malignant tumors.\n\nIn conclusion, the overexpression of EGFR is a common occurrence in various abdominal malignancies, including neuroblastoma, gastric carcinomas, esophageal carcinoma, endometrial adenocarcinoma, and ependymomas. This overexpression can be due to gene amplification or other mechanisms.

Unlike traditional content, metaverse content interacts with many users, so content accessibility is the first important part to consider. In other words, to maximize the quality of metaverse content, it is essential to pull out the optimal UX through a detailed HCI (human computer interaction) design. Metaverse content development methodologies have effective methods proposed by many researchers. However, they are limited to web-based metaverse content that limits the use of high-end hardware. They are ineffective for platforms such as PCs and VR devices, as most studies focus on improving the visual performance of PCs or high-performance VR devices. Therefore, unlike existing research, the key theme of our research is to study optimized development standards that can be applied to web-based metaverse content and find out their effects through experiments. We created a development standard to be applied to a Web-based platform based on the existing metaverse content development methodology. Then, we redeveloped the VR content into the metaverse content and named them the VR build and the metaverse build. We had 25 people play virtual reality builds and metaverse builds simultaneously. Then, we measured the overall experience with an evaluation tool called the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ); the GEQ is a proven tool for evaluating content experiences by dividing them into positive/negative scales. When comparing the results measured from the two builds, the metaverse build showed consistent results with a higher positive scale, and a lower negative scale, than the VR build. The results showed that users indeed rated metaverse content positively. The bottom line is that the web-based metaverse content development standards that we have produced are practical.

Then we summarize technical challenges that these architectures face in Metaverse and the existing solutions. Furthermore, we explore how the edge-Metaverse architecture technology helps Metaverse to interact and share digital data.

The metaverse is one of the emerging applications that got the advantages of this technological progression. Due to the cooperation between several cutting-edge technologies including IoT, digital twin (DT), and big data, the metaverse highly relies on the manipulation of an immense amount of gathered data. In this context, security is a major challenge, and as such, blockchain brings several advantages to the metaverse ecosystem as it allows secure and transparent data storage. However, with the dynamic nature of such an ecosystem and the fast variation in its AI-based services, the traditional blockchain features (e.g. smart contracts and consensus protocols) will face big challenges to meet the needed dynamic service requirements and scalability. This positioning paper proposes the concept of using a blockchain governed by AI to leverage the various features and advantages of blockchain services. The paper provides a review of the role of blockchain in the metaverse, challenges that arise, and then the role of AI in building intelligent blockchain features and their impact on the metaverse ecosystem.", "final_summary": "The Metaverse, a burgeoning digital frontier, presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for enhancing digital accessibility. The papers collectively suggest a range of technological solutions, tools, and best practices to address these challenges.\n\nFernandes (2022) underscores the importance of developing solutions to ensure accessibility for people with disabilities in the Metaverse. This sentiment is echoed by Parker (2023), who explores the potential for creating an inclusive and accessible Metaverse, particularly for individuals with physical and intellectual disabilities.\n\nThe role of edge computing in enhancing Metaverse accessibility is highlighted by Xu (2022) in two separate papers. The author suggests that leveraging next-generation communication systems and a cloud-edge-end computation framework could enable ubiquitous, seamless, and embodied access to the Metaverse. This is further supported by Chang (2022), who proposes the integration of 6G-enabled edge AI with the Metaverse to overcome resource and computing constraints.\n\nJeong (2023) emphasizes the importance of detailed Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design to maximize the quality of Metaverse content and enhance accessibility. The author also suggests the need for continuous research and experimentation to develop practical standards for web-based Metaverse content.\n\nWhile blockchain technologies are discussed by Xu (2022) and Bouachir (2022), they are primarily highlighted for their potential to aid in the interoperable development of the Metaverse and manage physical edge resources in a decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof manner. However, it's important to note that these technologies are not explicitly proposed as solutions for enhancing Metaverse accessibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the papers collectively suggest a multi-faceted approach to enhancing digital accessibility in the Metaverse. This includes the development of inclusive design practices, the integration of edge computing and AI technologies, and the exploration of blockchain for interoperability and resource management.

This allows for studies to be carried outside lab settings, as well as many commercial applications. As recordings are done over extended periods, these devices generate large volumes of data, mainly if the neuronal activity is recorded through multiple channels. Machine learning (ML) techniques allow to effectively analyse and use this data for a wide range of applications. However the portability of these techniques can be challenging.

These devices have been used in a wide variety of fields ranging from engineering to cognitive neuroscience. PURPOSE The aim of this study was to chart peer-review articles that used currently available consumer-grade EEG devices to collect neural data. We provide an overview of the research conducted with these relatively more affordable and user-friendly devices. We also inform future research by exploring the current and potential scope of consumer-grade EEG. METHODS We followed a five-stage methodological framework for a scoping review that included a systematic search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. We searched the following electronic databases: PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. We charted study data according to application (BCI, experimental research, validation, signal processing, and clinical) and location of use as indexed by the first author\u2019s country. RESULTS We identified 916 studies that used data recorded with consumer-grade EEG: 531 were reported in journal articles and 385 in conference papers. Emotiv devices were most used, followed by the NeuroSky MindWave, OpenBCI, interaXon Muse, and MyndPlay Mindband. The most common use was for brain-computer interfaces, followed by experimental research, signal processing, validation, and clinical purposes.

We will look at how the various characteristics of visual stimulation affect the measured electro-physiological response of the brain and describe the optimal parameters found that elicit a steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) in certain parts of the cerebral cortex where it can be reliably perceived by the electrode of the EEG device. After that, we continue with a description of the advanced machine learning pipeline model that can perform confident classification of the collected EEG data in order to (a) reliably distinguish signal from noise (about 85% validation score) and (b) reliably distinguish between EEG records collected from different human participants (about 80% validation score). Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed method works reliably even with an inexpensive (less than $100) consumer-grade EEG sensing device and with participants who do not have previous experience with EEG technology (EEG illiterate). All this in combination opens up broad prospects for the development of new types of consumer devices, [e.g.] based on virtual reality helmets or augmented reality glasses where EEG sensor can be easily integrated. The proposed method can be used to improve an online user experience by providing [e.g.] password-less user identification for VR / AR applications. It can also find a more advanced application in intensive care units where collected EEG data can be used to classify the level of conscious awareness of patients during anesthesia or to automatically detect hardware failures by classifying the input signal as noise.\n\n==\n\nPathirana 2018:\n\nTitle: A Critical Evaluation on Low-Cost Consumer-Grade Electroencephalographic Devices\n\nAbstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) has been recognized as one the finest cost-effective techniques to measure the electrical activity of the human brain. Since the electrical activity measured at the scalp is an abstract representation of the regional brain activity of the human brain, the EEG readings (EEG data) are often useful in many aspects. The value of an EEG data is proportionate to an electrical potential measured at a specific position on the scalp using an electrode. One of the major uses of EEG data from the medical domain is detecting the brain disorders such as Epileptic Seizure. Brain Computer Interfacing (BCI) is another use of EEG data. The paper discusses the analytical procedures of EEG data acquired using consumer-grade low-cost EEG devices in order to achieve the objective of implementation of a cost-effective BCI system. Furthermore, the paper presents a critical evaluation of some selected consumer-grade EEG devices from the point of view of cost-effectiveness against the expected accuracy. We have obtained a maximum of 76.6% for user intention detection with a low-cost EEG device Emotiv's \u201cInsight\u201d. This is a remarkable achievement in a context that, the maximum accuracy reported for the EEG devices in the class was only 60.57%. We emphasize the key impact behind this achievement is the employment of the technique Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach, for EEG data analysis and intention classification.\n\n==\n\nHosseini 2020:\n\nTitle: A Review on Machine Learning for EEG Signal Processing in Bioengineering\n\nAbstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) has been a staple method for identifying certain health conditions in patients since its discovery. Due to the many different types of classifiers available to use, the analysis methods are also equally numerous. In this review, we will be examining specifically machine learning methods that have been developed for EEG analysis with bioengineering applications. We reviewed literature from 1988 to 2018 to capture previous and current classification methods for EEG in multiple applications. From this information, we are able to determine the overall effectiveness of each machine learning method as well as the key characteristics. We have found that all the primary methods used in machine learning have been applied in some form in EEG classification. This ranges from Naive-Bayes to Decision Tree/Random Forest, to Support Vector Machine (SVM). Supervised learning methods are on average of higher accuracy than their unsupervised counterparts. This includes SVM and KNN. While each of the methods individually is limited in their accuracy in their respective applications, there is hope that the combination of methods when implemented properly has a higher overall classification accuracy. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of Machine Learning applications used in EEG analysis. It also gives an overview of each of the methods and general applications that each is best suited to.\n\n==\n\nGoldberg 2012:\n\nTitle: The Feasibility of Consumer Grade EEG Devices as Computer Input\n\nAbstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a technology that records electrical brain activity through electrodes, and outputs signals that can then be used for a variety of applications. Although EEG has been used in research and clinically for decades, user friendly, consumer-affordable (~$100), non-invasive EEG devices have only been on the market for the last two to three years. Many applications have been developed using consumer-grade EEG, mostly along the lines of \"biofeedback,\u201d where the goal is to achieve and maintain brainwave activity in a desirable state for an extended period; for example, success is often marked by the shifting of a user's brain activity towards a relaxed or meditative state and holding it there for as long as possible. Such unidirectional control is useful for cognitive and emotional response training, but falls short of allowing user- directed control analogous to devices such as knobs and joysticks, e.g., allowing a user to intentionally manipulate and regulate such devices bi- or multi-directionally via thought control. Such a manipulable EEG control would be highly beneficial for medical applications, such as improved computer interfaces and/or control of prostheses for people with disabilities, in addition to lifestyle applications, such as gaming and music performance and production. This study serves as a proof-of-concept and preliminary exploration of the viability of various techniques for the use of consumer-grade EEG devices as a control input that can be manipulated by the user, having concluded that a significant majority of users report being able to control the cursor, and appear to be able to move the cursor in the direction indicated by the test software.\n\n==\n\nCi 2015:\n\nTitle: The key techniques research on portable EEG examination expert system\n\nAbstract: In this paper we present an EEG detection system, which is a low-cost, portable, popularization.

In the present study, the neuroprotective effect of baicalein (a phenolic flavonoid in the dried root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) on acrolein-induced neurodegeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic system was investigated using local infusion of acrolein in the substantia nigra (SN) of rat brain. Systemic administration of baicalein (30\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) significantly attenuated acrolein-induced elevations in 4-hydroxy-2-noneal (a product of lipid peroxidation), N-(3-formyl-3,4-dehydropiperidino)lysine (a biomarker of acrolein-conjugated proteins), and heme-oxygenase-1 levels (a redox-regulated protein) in the infused SN, indicating that baicalein inhibited acrolein-induced oxidative stress and protein conjugation. Furthermore, baicalein reduced acrolein-induced elevations in glial fibrillary acidic protein (a biomarker of activated astrocytes), ED-1 (a biomarker of activated microglia), and mature cathepsin B levels (a cysteine lysosomal protease), suggesting that baicalein attenuated acrolein-induced neuroinflammation. Moreover, baicalein attenuated acrolein-induced caspase 1 activation (a pro-inflammatory caspase) and interleukin-1\u03b2 levels, indicating that baicalein prevented acrolein-induced inflammasome activation. In addition, baicalein significantly attenuated acrolein-induced caspase 3 activation (a biomarker of apoptosis) as well as acrolein-induced elevation in receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 3 levels (an initiator of necroptosis), indicating that baicalein attenuated apoptosis and necroptosis. At the same time, baicalein mitigated acrolein-induced reduction in dopamine levels in the striatum ipsilateral to acrolein-infused SN. In conclusion, our data suggest that baicalein is neuroprotective via inhibiting oxidative stress, protein conjugation, and inflammation. Furthermore, baicalein prevents acrolein-induced program cell deaths, suggesting that baicalein is therapeutically useful for slowing PD progression.\n\n==\n\nJiang 2010:\n\nTitle: Baicalein reduces E46K \u03b1\u2010synuclein aggregation in vitro and protects cells against E46K \u03b1\u2010synuclein toxicity in cell models of familiar Parkinsonism\n\nAbstract: J.

In this paper we present a conceptually simple and effective transfer learning approach that addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we combine the task-specific optimization function with an auxiliary language model objective, which is adjusted during the training process. This preserves language regularities captured by language models, while enabling sufficient adaptation for solving the target task. Our method does not require pretraining or finetuning separate components of the network and we train our models end-to-end in a single step.

It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.\n\n==\n\nYoon 2017:\n\nTitle: Efficient Transfer Learning Schemes for Personalized Language Modeling using Recurrent Neural Network\n\nAbstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient transfer leaning methods for training a personalized language model using a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory architecture. With our proposed fast transfer learning schemes, a general language model is updated to a personalized language model with a small amount of user data and a limited computing resource. These methods are especially useful for a mobile device environment while the data is prevented from transferring out of the device for privacy purposes. Through experiments on dialogue data in a drama, it is verified that our transfer learning methods have successfully generated the personalized language model, whose output is more similar to the personal language style in both qualitative and quantitative aspects.\n\n==\n\nWang 2021:\n\nTitle: Meta Distant Transfer Learning for Pre-trained Language Models\n\nAbstract: With the wide availability of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), multi-task fine-tuning across domains has been extensively applied. For tasks related to distant domains with different class label sets, PLMs may memorize non-transferable knowledge for the target domain and suffer from negative transfer. Inspired by meta-learning, we propose the Meta Distant Transfer Learning (Meta-DTL) framework to learn the cross-task knowledge for PLM-based methods. Meta-DTL first employs task representation learning to mine implicit relations among multiple tasks and classes. Based on the results, it trains a PLM-based meta-learner to capture the transferable knowledge across tasks. The weighted maximum entropy regularizers are proposed to make meta-learner more task-agnostic and unbiased. Finally, the meta-learner can be fine-tuned to fit each task with better parameter initialization. We evaluate Meta-DTL using both BERT and ALBERT on seven public datasets. Experiment results confirm the superiority of Meta-DTL as it consistently outperforms strong baselines. We find that Meta-DTL is highly effective when very few data is available for the target task.\n\n==\n\nSchioppa 2023:\n\nTitle: Cross-Lingual Supervision improves Large Language Models Pre-training\n\nAbstract: The recent rapid progress in pre-training Large Language Models has relied on using self-supervised language modeling objectives like next token prediction or span corruption. On the other hand, Machine Translation Systems are mostly trained using cross-lingual supervision that requires aligned data between source and target languages. We demonstrate that pre-training Large Language Models on a mixture of a self-supervised Language Modeling objective and the supervised Machine Translation objective, therefore including cross-lingual parallel data during pre-training, yields models with better in-context learning abilities. As pre-training is a very resource-intensive process and a grid search on the best mixing ratio between the two objectives is prohibitively expensive, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to learn it during pre-training.\n\n==\n\nRadford 2019:\n\nTitle: Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners\n\nAbstract: Natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization, are typically approached with supervised learning on taskspecific datasets. We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits WebText. Samples from the model reflect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text.

We find that the impact of low rates on the profitability of banks' traditional intermediation activity helps explain the subdued evolution of lending in the period 2010-14.\n\n==\n\nHe 2013:\n\nTitle: Monetary Policy and Bank Lending in China \u2014 Evidence from Loan-Level Data\n\nAbstract: We investigate how monetary policy in a mixed financial system such as that of China, which is characterized by a juxtaposition of quantity- and price-based policy instruments and the co-existence of regulated and market-determined interest rates, affects bank lending. Using a newly constructed loan-level dataset, we find that loan rates but not loan size are affected by both the regulated and the market-determined interest rates and that loan size is instead affected by an implicit quota that is imposed on aggregate bank lending through window guidance. We interpret this finding to be evidence of credit rationing.\n\n==\n\nKashyap 1993:\n\nTitle: Monetary Policy and Bank Lending\n\nAbstract: This paper surveys recent work that relates to the \"lending\" view of monetary policy transmission.

Concretely, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the relationships between the monetary policy of central banks, the loan policy of commercial banks, and the investment behavior of firms. We focus on countries that conduct their monetary policy under the inflation-targeting framework. Our empirical analysis with data from Germany, Switzerland and Thailand provides several new insights. First, after controlling for the US monetary policy, the monetary policy in Germany and Thailand appears to influence the banks' lending rate in the short run (i.e. within two months), whereas the monetary policy in Switzerland seems to be ineffective at influencing the banks' lending rate in the short run. Second, our results show that the banks' lending rate has a negative effect on their loans and that this negative effect is weakened by their growth opportunities. Third, we find that the supply of bank loans plays a more pivotal role in determining firms' investment than the lending rate. Last but not least, we document that neither the lending rate nor the loan-to-assets ratio moderates the sensitivity of the firms' investment to growth opportunities.\n\n==\n\nBenetton 2021:\n\nTitle: Targeted monetary policy and bank lending behavior\n\nAbstract: Abstract We exploit an allocation rule set by the ECB for the first series of TLTROs to study the effects of targeted monetary policy on banks\u2019 credit supply to firms.

These studies have established that, under certain conditions, the traditional transmission mechanism for monetary policy (\"the money view\") may be augmented through changes in the supply of bank loans (\"the lending view\"). Because both the money view and the lending view operate through the banking sector, the health of the banking system, insofar as it affects bank behavior, is an important factor in the transmission of monetary policy. It affects both the nature and the size of bank responses to shifts in monetary policy, with particular relevance for the bank lending channel. The traditional description of monetary policy generally emphasizes the reserve requirement constraint on banks. In this story, banks are an important link in the transmission of monetary policy because changes in bank reserves influence the quantity of reservable deposits held by banks. Because banks rarely hold significant excess reserves, the resel~ce requirement constraint typically is considered to be binding at all times. However, a second constraint on banks, the capital constraint, may be more important in accounting for the variability in the magnitude of the effect of monetary policy over time. The extent to which a capital constraint is binding, unlike the reserve requirement, is likely to vary\n\n==\n\nMatemilola 2015:\n\nTitle: The impact of monetary policy on bank lending rate in South Africa\n\nAbstract: The pass-through of the policy rates to bank lending rate is an important subject matter because it measures the effectiveness of monetary policy to control inflation or stabilize the economy. This study investigates the long-run interest rate pass-through of the money market rate to the bank lending rate and asymmetric adjustment of the bank lending rate. The study applies the momentum threshold autoregressive and asymmetric error correction models. The asymmetric error correction results reveal that bank lending rate adjusts to a decrease in the money market rate in South Africa. The findings suggest that the South African commercial banks adjust their lending rate downward but the lending rate appears rigid upward, which supports the customer reaction hypothesis.", "final_summary": "Monetary policy and its influence on bank lending is a complex and multifaceted topic.

This study examines the performance of a lab-scale aerated sequencing batch reactor (SBR) in degrading cassava mill effluent using palm kernel ( Elaeis guineensis ) shell (PKS) as biofilter media. Wastewater samples were collected before and after flowing through each compartment at hydraulic retention times of 3, 5 and 7 hours. Continuous aeration and nature-based degradation of the effluent recorded overall removal efficiencies of 73.5% (Hydrogen cyanide), 70.59% (BOD), 69.18% (COD), 29.93% (Turbidity), 4.92% (Sodium), 25% (Magnesium) and 14.32% (Calcium) respectively. Effluent electrical conductivity (EC) slightly increased by 7.84%. The Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) of the treated wastewater ranged from 6.9 to 7.3 while the final pH ranged from 4.5 to 4.6. The values of EC, BOD and COD were significantly different ( P <0.05) along the treatment sequence, confirming the effectiveness of the chambers in reducing these pollutants.

As such during processing large wastes are generated including chaff, palm press fiber, palm kernel shell, empty fruit bunch (EFB) and palm oil mill effluents from oil palm and cassava peels and cassava mill effluents (CME). These wastes are discharged into the ecosystem without treatment where they cause attendant environmental impacts. This study evaluated bioethanol production from CME supplemented with chaff, EFB and cassava peels through separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) techniques. CME with initial pH of 3.6 were used for hydrolysis and results showed a total reducing sugar of 0.31\u00b10.006 mg/ml (CME + EFB -Treatment A), 0.25\u00b10.002 mg/ml (CME +Chaff - Treatment B), 0.43\u00b10.007 mg/ml CME + Cassava peels Treatment C) and 0.20\u00b10.002mg/ml (CME i.e not hydrolyzed \u2013 Treatment D).

This study explores the utilization of agro-industrial wastewater collected from cassava mills as a resource for electricity generation by microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Mixed culture sludge was used to inoculate the bottom chamber of the MFCs whilst cassava mill wastewater was used in the MFCs. Experimental results showed that the MFCs could generate electricity from full-strength cyanide laden wastewater (16000\u00a0mg-COD/L, 86\u00a0mg/L cyanide) with a maximum power density of 1771\u00a0mW/m 2 .

The results of the physicochemical analysis showed overall decrease in pH values and corresponding increase in the other parameters. The pH values indicated that the soils were acidic which suggests that the effluents imparted acidic property on the soils. The elevated levels of Total Organic Carbon and Total Nitrogen are suggestive of increased organic matter and microbial activities in the effluent residues. Electrical conductivity values indicate presence of dissolved inorganic salts while the phosphorus values confirm the rich source of phosphorus in cassava tuber. The result of heavy metal analysis shows elevated levels of heavy metals in the soil receiving cassava mill effluent. The relative potential index and enrichment coefficient values of the metals in the soils coupled with the observed physiochemical characteristics revealed that there are some levels of heavy metal enrichment, contamination and bioavailability in the soils studied.

During processing, large volume of effluents are produced in the pressing stage of cassava tuber processing. The cassava mill effluents are discharged into the soil directly and it drain into nearby pits, surface water, and canals without treatment. Cassava mill effluents is known to alter the receiving soil and water characteristics and affects the biota in such environments, such as fishes (water), domestic animals, and vegetation (soil). This study investigated the potential of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to be used for the treatment of some physicochemical properties of cassava mill effluents. S. cerevisiae was isolated from palm wine and identified based on conventional microbiological techniques, viz. morphological, cultural, and physiological/biochemical characteristics. The S. cerevisiae was inoculated into sterile cassava mill effluents and incubated for 15 days. Triplicate samples were withdrawn from the setup after the fifth day of treatment. Portable equipment was used to analyze the in-situ parameters, viz. total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, salinity, and turbidity. Anions (nitrate, sulphate, and phosphate) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were analyzed using spectrophotometric and open reflux methods respectively. Results showed a decline of 37.62%, 22.96%, 29.63%, 20.49%, 21.44%, 1.70%, 53.48%, 68.00%, 100%, and 74.48% in pH, conductivity, DO, TDS, salinity, sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, and COD levels respectively, and elevation of 17.17% by turbidity. The study showed that S. cerevisiae could be used for the treatment of cassava mill effluents prior to being discharged into the environment so as to reduce the pollution or contamination and toxicity levels.\n\n==\n\nOrhue 2014:\n\nTitle: Effect of Cassava mill effluent on some soil chemical properties and the growth of fluted pumpkin (Telfairia occidentalis Hook F.)\n\nAbstract: In the trials, Cassava mill Effluent was used for fluted pumpkin (Telfairia occidentalis) cultivation in order to verify the influence of the effluent on the growth and some soil chemical properties. In this regard, a completely randomized and randomized complete block designs were used in the greenhouse and field trials respectively with 6 treatments replicated 3 times. In the greenhouse, the following rates of 0, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 ml per 5 kg topsoil were used while in the field trial, 0, 40000, 80000, 120000, 160000 and 200000 litres/ha were utilized. The rates used in the field were equivalent to those of greenhouse. In both trials, the cassava mill effluent was applied 2 weeks prior to transplanting the seedlings. Results indicated that the cassava mill effluent significantly (P < 0.05) increased soil pH, organic carbon, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Cu and Zn whereas the exchangeable acidity decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with corresponding increase in cassava mill effluent treatments. Except N and Na, which declined with corresponding increase in the cassava mill effluent treatments, an improved P, K, Mg, Ca, Fe, Cu and Zn components was achieved in cassava mill effluent polluted plants compared to control. The plant height, significantly (P < 0.05) decreased with increased cassava mill effluent treatment in the greenhouse trial while in the field trial, 120000 litres/ha was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than other treatments.

Cassava is produced in the tropical and sub-tropical countries. Currently, the global production of cassava is about 215,436,496 tons. Out of these, Nigeria accounts for 20.3%, being the largest producing nation. During processing of cassava flour (Gari), three main wastes are generated including cassava mill effluents (CME), solid and gaseous emission. This paper reviews the impacts of CME in Nigeria. The study found that CME\u2019s physicochemical quality often exceeds the limit for effluents discharge onto land and surface water as recommended by Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA), Nigeria. CME alters the quality of soil and water with regard to physicochemical, heavy metal and microbial characteristics. CME can induce toxicological effects on the environments and its biota including humans, fisheries, flora and fauna. The impacts are mostly associated with physicochemical (viz: odour, cyanide, acidic, dissolved oxygen, biological and chemical oxygen demand, conductivity) and heavy metals characteristics. Therefore, there is the need for treatment and sustainable management strategies of CME through biotechnological advancement.

The continued supply of these materials is seen as an important component in the business's long-term success. The company has a long history of seeking to farm responsibly on company farms and for directly contracted raw materials, but it became clear that an approach based solely on suppliers' good agricultural practice would not safeguard supplies where increasing social and environmental pressures on agriculture were growing, or where increasing consumer concerns about the food chain could undermine markets and brands. Both threats suggested the need for a more radical approach. This resulted in the development of a mission statement, the agreement of four principles for sustainable agriculture, the identification of ten sustainable agriculture indicators (later 11), and the selection of five key crops the sustainable supply of which was significant to the company. This paper summarizes progress towards the sustainable supply of these crops by reporting on selected sustainability indicators for the crops (peas, spinach, tomatoes, tea and oil palm) in 11 countries. Some of the businesses using these products have been subsequently sold, but these are reported here because the aim is to explore how responsive are different indicators of sustainability to management action in different crops in widely differing locations. This paper focuses on a selection of findings for each of the 10 indicators, in order to illustrate the extent of changes that have been observed over time. These also indicate some of the difficulties faced in making improvements on the ground. The gathering of data on sustainability indicators is closely tied to the development of alternative practices that should quickly deliver improvements in a variety of outcomes. An assessment is also made of the key changes that have occurred for each of the main five crops as a result of adopting the sustainability indicator system and associated new management practices. Multi-year assessments were conceived as the way to understand and demonstrate progress towards more sustainable agriculture. The important developments were of systems that combined ensuring that agricultural suppliers performed to an acceptable set of criteria, and then had the capacity and willingness to identify the most critical areas where further progress was required. The challenge for the company is now to encourage others to adopt their approach to making supply chains more sustainable, both for their customers and the consumers of their branded goods.\n\n==\n\nGorman 2006:\n\nTitle: Unilever (B)\n\nAbstract: Jan-Kees Vis, a staff worker in the middle echelons of the company, attempts to integrate sustainable development into existing environmental policy in hopes of providing a plan of action for achieving sustainability.

A well-structured and coordinated health information management system has been known to generate the information needed for decision-making at all levels of healthcare delivery. However, the state of health information management in Nigeria, as is the case in most African countries, is a cause for concern. Observation and past studies have highlighted challenges facing the practice of health information management in Africa to be centred around the quality of professional training, inadequately qualified practitioners, disgruntled practitioners, government\u2019s indifference towards the practice, lack of policies and inadequate technological infrastructure among others. This article examines some of the challenges facing health information management practice in Nigeria and makes recommendations that may uplift the profession.\n\n==\n\nOmole 2015:\n\nTitle: Health Management Information System for Decision-Making in Nigeria: Challenges and Resolutions\n\nAbstract: Health Information System (HIS) refers to any organized effort to systematically collect, maintain and disseminate data relevant to the performance of a health system or any of its component parts. As such, any health system has potentially many health applications functioning within it. Not only are the health challenges facing developing countries (Nigeria) enormous, the health systems that addresses those challenges are struggling with limited resources, capability, technology etc. The need to find ways to strengthen health systems overall is therefore vital. The use and knowledge of HIS in Nigeria hospitals is still below what it should be. As technology seem to be advancing each day, information generation behind the health sector seem not to. Applications of IT in health are so rampant now, making it easier to treat patients and manage information about them. Information is critical in making healthrelated decisions. The Health Management Information System (HMIS) aims at developing a culture of information use amongst health care workers through the development of knowledge and skills in data handling in order to create locally relevant information for use in the management of district level health and service programs. HMIS does not inform policy alone but also improve care at the point of service. It involves better information management tools at the local level, data capture through routine business operations, identification of the minimum essential data sets, growth of specialized technology and providers. Etc. Challenges and reasons for the failure of HIS in Nigeria will be discussed. This study will look at one of the software tools used in health care analysis of data and how it is used for decision-making. In addition, it will look at measures that need to be set in place for HMIS to achieve its goal.\n\n==\n\nOluwaseun 2015:\n\nTitle: Strategies for Managing Information Flow in Nigeria Healthcare System\n\nAbstract: The healthcare system is an information intensive domain that is responsible for capturing, processing and storing large volumes of health information which could be clinical, research or administrative in nature. Healthcare information is primarily used for making decisions, improving the efficiency and quality of healthcare systems as well as conducting research to enhance medical science in both developed and developing countries. Healthcare information is usually stored in paper form, physical files or digital formats. However, developing countries such as Nigeria are faced with the challenge of moving from paper based health information system towards the digital formats that facilitates an integrated computerized health information system. Nevertheless, healthcare information is usually transmitted among disparate healthcare providers within or across different healthcare institutions. However, healthcare entities in developing countries are plagued with the difficulty of how to successfully and effectively manage information as it flows across the continuum of care. Consequently, this results in inappropriate decision making, ineffective planning, increase in medical errors and cost as well as a decline in the quality of patients\u2019 care. Based on this background, this paper appraises how information flows within and across diverse healthcare organizations in developing countries with a particular reference to Nigeria. The paper also recommends ways of managing information flow within the Nigeria healthcare system.\n\n==\n\nAdeleke 2015:\n\nTitle: Information Technology Skills and Training Needs of Health Information Management Professionals in Nigeria: A Nationwide Study\n\nAbstract: There is a lack of effective health information management systems in Nigeria due to the prevalence of cumbersome paper-based and disjointed health data management systems. This can make informed healthcare decision making difficult. This study examined the information technology (IT) skills, utilisation and training needs of Nigerian health information management professionals. We deployed a cross-sectional structured questionnaire to determine the IT skills and training needs of health information management professionals who have leadership roles in the nation's healthcare information systems (n=374). It was found that ownership of a computer, level of education and age were associated with knowledge and perception of IT. The vast majority of participants (98.8%) acknowledged the importance and relevance of IT in healthcare information systems and many expressed a desire for further IT training, especially in statistical analysis. Despite this, few (8.1 %) worked in settings where such systems operate and there exists an IT skill gap among these professionals which is not compatible with their roles in healthcare information systems. To rectify this anomaly they require continuing professional development education, especially in the areas of health IT. Government intervention in the provision of IT infrastructure in order to put into practice a computerised healthcare information system would therefore be a worthwhile undertaking.\n\n==\n\nAdeleke 2015:\n\nTitle: Information technology skills and training needs of health information management professionals in Nigeria: a nationwide study.\n\nAbstract: There is a lack of effective health information management systems in Nigeria due to the prevalence of cumbersome paper-based and disjointed health data management systems.

The study was focused on the perceived paucity of health information technology policy in Nigeria and the causes of poor implementation of hospital information systems in the country. The findings of the literature review highlighted hindrances to the adoption of hospital information systems to include; the high cost of full implementation of a hospital information system, inadequate human capital, corruption, and problems associated with poor infrastructure in Nigeria. The recommendations were that, the Nigerian government needs to provide stable electricity, basic communication infrastructures, and Internet access to boost private initiatives in the adoption of health information technology across the country.\n\n==\n\nIdowu 2008:\n\nTitle: Health informatics deployment in Nigeria\n\nAbstract: Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has become a major tool in delivery of health services and has had a revolutionary impact on how we live and perceive the world.

Over the past 10\u00a0years, Columbus, Ohio, has experienced a housing downturn, recovery, and subsequent increases. This allows to investigate the response of housing market in different periods of the recession. Ordinary and geographically-weighted regression (GWR) models were developed to examine global and local built-environment effects on home-price appreciations for the three periods while controlling for other physical and socioeconomic variables. The results found that home buyers showed an unchanged preference for residential privacy and amenity and avoided those features that might attract negative external effects from a period to another. The home-price appreciation rates showed different spatial patterns across the study region in the three periods. Nevertheless, the results suggested that suburban areas, particularly those in northern Columbus, better resisted, recovered from, and adapted to the recession. In the wake of the recession, a smaller house was preferred by home buyers. GWR models also provided some interesting findings. In the downturn, accessibility to a park or library helped sustain home prices in the northwest. Bus stop density had a positive effect in eastern Columbus in the recovery, most likely due to the high fuel price at that time. Neighborhoods with a higher income better retained their home value in the downturn, especially those in southern Columbus. Finally, this study found that the recession hit harder on minority neighborhoods in all three periods. This finding suggests that housing policies should focus on these neighborhoods with other social support.\n\n==\n\nAubuchon 2010:\n\nTitle: The geographic distribution and characteristics of U.S. bank failures, 2007-2010: do bank failures still reflect local economic conditions?\n\nAbstract: The financial crisis and recession that began in 2007 brought a sharp increase in the number of bank failures in the United States. This article investigates characteristics of banks that failed and regional patterns in bank failure rates during 2007-10. The article compares the recent experience with that of 1987-92, when the United States last experienced a high number of bank failures. As during the 1987-92 and prior episodes, bank failures during 2007-10 were concentrated in regions of the country that experienced the most serious distress in real estate markets and the largest declines in economic activity. Although most legal restrictions on branch banking were eliminated in the 1990s, the authors find that many banks continue to operate in a small number of markets and are vulnerable to localized economic shocks.\n\n==\n\nAalbers 2009:\n\nTitle: Geographies of the financial crisis\n\nAbstract: Real estate is, by definition, local as it is spatially fixed. Mortgage lending, however, has developed from a local to a national market and is increasingly a global market today. An understanding of the financial crisis is ultimately a spatialised understanding of the linkages between local and global. This article looks at the geographies of the mortgage crisis and credit crunch and asks the question: how are different places affected by the crisis? The article looks at different states, different cities, different neighbourhoods and different financial centres. Investors in many places had invested in residential mortgage backed securities and have seen their value drop. Housing bubbles, faltering economies and regulation together have shaped the geography of the financial crisis on the state and city level in the US. Subprime and predatory lending have affected low-income and minority communities more than others and we therefore not only see a concentration of foreclosures in certain cities, but also in certain neighbourhoods. On an international level, the long-term economical and political consequences of this are still mostly unknown, but it is clear that some financial centres in Asia (including the Middle East) will become more important now that globalisation is coming full circle. This article does not present new empirical research, but brings together work from different literatures that all in some way have a specific angle on the financial crisis. The aim of this article is to make the geographical dimensions of the financial crisis understandable to geographers that are not specialists in all - or even any - of these literatures, so that they can comprehend the spatialisation of this crisis.\n\n==\n\nCohen 2016:\n\nTitle: Spatial effects and house price dynamics in the USA\n\nAbstract: While an understanding of spatial spillovers and feedbacks in housing markets could provide valuable information for location decisions, little known research has examined this issue for the US Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). Also, it is unknown whether there can be differences in the spatial effects before and after a major housing \u201cbust\u201d. In this paper we examine spatial effects in house price dynamics. Using panel data from 363 US MSAs for 1996 to 2013, we find that there are significant spatial diffusion patterns in the growth rates of urban house prices. Lagged price changes of neighboring areas show greater effects after the 2007\u201308 housing crash than over the entire sample period of 1996\u20132013. In general, the findings are robust to controlling for potential endogeneity, and for various spatial weights specifications (including contiguity weights and migration flows). These results underscore the importance of considering spatial spillovers in MSA-level studies of housing price growth.\n\n==\n\nMartin 2011:\n\nTitle: The local geographies of the financial crisis: from the housing bubble to economic recession and beyond\n\nAbstract: The recent financial crisis, with its origins in the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage boom and house price bubble in the USA, is a shown to have been a striking example of \u2018glocalisation\u2019, with distinctly locally varying origins and global consequences and feedbacks. The shift from a \u2018locally originate and locally-hold\u2019 model of mortgage provision to a securitised \u2018locally originate and globally distribute\u2019 model meant that when local subprime mortgage markets collapsed in the USA, the repercussions were felt globally. At the same time, the global credit crunch and the deep recession the global financial crisis precipitated have had locally varying impacts and consequences. Not only does a geographical perspective throw important light on the nature and dynamics of the recent financial meltdown, the latter in turn should give impetus for a more general research effort into the economic geography of bubbles and crashes.\n\n==\n\nCohen 2012:\n\nTitle: The boom and bust of U.S. housing prices from various geographic perspectives\n\nAbstract: This paper summarizes changes in housing prices during the recent U.S. boom and bust from various geographic perspectives. Nationally, the Standard & Poor\u2019s/Case-Shiller house price index more than doubled in nominal terms during the boom and has fallen by roughly a third subsequently. During the boom, housing prices tended to rise much faster in metropolitan areas in the East and West Coast regions than in the country\u2019s interior. After adjusting for inflation, 7 of 19 metropolitan areas have experienced real declines in housing prices from the start of the boom to the present. Although lower-priced houses showed a larger percentage increase during the boom, higher-priced houses fared relatively better over the boom and bust. Changes in land prices, which are not easily measured, appear to have driven housing prices to a greater extent than changes in the prices of housing structures. Internationally, seven countries experienced housing booms and busts; however, these countries tended to have larger booms and smaller absolute busts than the United States.\n\n==\n\nMoscone 2014:\n\nTitle: Real estate market and financial stability in US metropolitan areas: A dynamic model with spatial effects\n\nAbstract: This paper investigates spatio-temporal variations in ex-post credit risk in the United States, as a function of real estate prices, loan purchases made by government sponsored enterprises, and a set of local characteristics during the recent housing boom and bust.\n\n==\n\nBrown 2013:\n\nTitle: Housing Foreclosure as A Geographically Contingent Event: Columbus Ohio 2003\u20132007\n\nAbstract: This article seeks to better understand geographic manifestations of housing foreclosure, moving beyond the usual portrayal that highlights, e.g., race/ethnicity and income.

Unique areas are examined by neighborhood reconnaissance, exploratory data analysis, interviews, and archival research. Relevant factors include race/ethnicity and socio-economic characteristics.

In response, a dedicated emergency response intubation team (ERIT) consisting of anesthesiologists and allied health providers was instituted for our emergency department (ED). Given the high-risk nature of intubations and the new interprofessional team dynamics, we sought to assess health-care provider experiences and potential areas of improvement. Methods Surveys were distributed to healthcare providers at the University Health Network, a quaternary healthcare centre in Toronto, Canada, which includes two urban EDs seeing over 128,000 patients per year. Participants included ED physicians and nurses, anesthesiologists, anesthesia assistants, and operating room nurses. The survey included free-text questions. Responses underwent thematic analysis using grounded theory and were independently coded by two authors to generate descriptive themes. Discrepancies were resolved with a third author. Descriptive themes were distilled through an inductive, iterative process until fewer main themes emerged. Results A total of 178 surveys were collected (68.2% response rate). Of these, 123 (69%) participated in one or more ERIT activations. Positive aspects included increased numbers of staff to assist, increased intubation expertise, improved safety, and good team dynamics within the ERIT team. Challenges included a loss of scope (primarily ED physicians and nurses) and unfamiliar workflows, perceived delays to ERIT team arrival or patient intubation, role confusion, handover concerns, and communication challenges between ED and ERIT teams. Perceived opportunities for improvement included interprofessional training, developing clear guidelines on activation, inter-team role clarification, and guidelines on handover processes post-intubation. Conclusions Healthcare providers perceived that a novel interprofessional collaboration for intubations of COVID-19 patients presented both benefits and challenges. Opportunities for improvement centred around interprofessional training, shared decision making between teams, and structured handoff processes.\n\n==\n\nSakles 2019:\n\nTitle: Improvement in the Safety of Rapid Sequence Intubation in the Emergency Department with the Use of an Airway Continuous Quality Improvement Program\n\nAbstract: Introduction Airway management in the critically ill is associated with a high prevalence of failed first attempts and adverse events which negatively impacts patient care. The purpose of this investigation is to describe an airway continuous quality improvement (CQI) program and its effect on the safety of rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in the emergency department (ED) over a 10-year period. Methods An airway CQI program with an ongoing airway registry was initiated in our ED on July 1, 2007 (Academic Year 1) and continued through June 30, 2017 (Academic Year 10). Data were prospectively collected on all patients intubated in the ED during this period using a structured airway data collection form. Key data points included method of intubation, drugs and devices used for intubation, operator specialty and level of training, number of intubation attempts, and adverse events. Adult patients who underwent RSI in the ED with an initial intubation attempt by emergency medicine (EM) resident were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was first pass success which was defined as successful tracheal intubation with a single laryngoscope insertion. The secondary outcome was the prevalence of adverse events associated with intubation. Educational and clinical interventions were introduced throughout the study period with the goal of optimizing these outcomes. Data were analyzed by academic year and are reported descriptively with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the difference of means. Results EM residents performed RSI on 342 adult patients during Academic Year 1 and on 445 adult patients during Academic Year 10. Over the 10-year study period, first pass success increased from 73.1% to 92.4% (difference = 19.3%, 95% CI 14.0% to 24.6%). The percentage of patients who experienced an adverse event associated with intubation decreased from 22.5% to 14.4% (difference = \u22127.9%, 95% CI \u221213.4% to \u22122.4%). The percentage of patients with first pass success without an adverse event increased from 64.0% to 80.9% (difference = 16.9%, 95% CI 10.6% to 23.1%). Conclusion The use of an airway CQI program with an ongoing airway registry resulted in a substantial improvement in the overall safety of RSI in the ED as evidenced by an increase in first pass success and a decrease in adverse events.\n\n==\n\nDriver 2016:\n\nTitle: Direct Versus Video Laryngoscopy Using the C-MAC for Tracheal Intubation in the Emergency Department, a Randomized Controlled Trial.\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nDirect laryngoscopy (DL) has long been the most common approach for emergency endotracheal intubation, although the use of video laryngoscopy (VL) is becoming more widespread. Current observational data suggest that VL has higher first-pass success, although randomized trials are lacking.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objective was to compare first-pass success in patients undergoing emergency intubation with DL or VL using a C-MAC device.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was an open-label, prospective, randomized, controlled trial in an academic emergency department of patients undergoing emergency intubation with a plan of DL for the first attempt. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either DL or VL using a C-MAC device for the first intubation attempt. The primary outcome was first-pass success. Secondary outcomes included time to intubation, development of aspiration pneumonia, and hospital length of stay (LOS). The study was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01710891.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 198 patients were enrolled and intubated with either DL (n\u00a0=\u00a095) or VL (n\u00a0=\u00a0103). First-attempt success was 86 and 92% for the DL and VL groups, respectively (difference\u00a0=\u00a0-5.9%, 95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a0-14.5% to 2.7%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.18). Time to intubation, rates of aspiration pneumonia, and hospital LOS were not different between the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients undergoing emergency intubation in whom DL was planned for the first attempt, we did not detect a difference between VL or DL using the C-MAC device in first-pass success, duration of intubation attempt, aspiration pneumonia, or hospital LOS.\n\n==\n\nBrown 2015:\n\nTitle: Techniques, success, and adverse events of emergency department adult intubations.\n\nAbstract: STUDY OBJECTIVE\nWe describe the operators, techniques, success, and adverse event rates of adult emergency department (ED) intubation through multicenter prospective surveillance.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEighteen EDs in the United States, Canada, and Australia recorded intubation data onto a Web-based data collection tool, with a greater than or equal to 90% reporting compliance requirement. We report proportions with binomial 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and regression, with year as the dependent variable, to model change over time.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 18 participating centers, 5 were excluded for failing to meet compliance standards. From the remaining 13\u00a0centers, we report data on 17,583 emergency intubations of patients aged 15 years or older from 2002 to 2012. Indications were medical in 65% of patients and trauma in 31%. Rapid sequence intubation was the first method attempted in 85% of encounters. Emergency physicians managed 95% of intubations and most (79%) were physician trainees. Direct laryngoscopy was used in 84% of first attempts. Video laryngoscopy use increased from less than 1% in the first 3 years to 27% in the last 3 years (risk difference 27%; 95% CI 25% to 28%; mean odds ratio increase per year [ie,\u00a0slope] 1.7; 95% CI 1.6 to 1.8). Etomidate was used in 91% and succinylcholine in 75% of rapid sequence intubations. Among rapid sequence intubations, rocuronium use increased from 8.2% in the first 3 years to 42% in the last 3 years (mean odds ratio increase per year 1.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 1.3). The first-attempt intubation success rate was 83% (95% CI 83% to 84%) and was higher in the last 3 years than in the first 3 (86% versus 80%; risk difference 6.2%; 95% CI 4.2% to 7.8%). The airway was successfully secured in 99.4% of encounters (95% CI 99.3% to 99.6%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn the EDs we studied, emergency intubation has a high and increasing success rate.

The orotracheal route was used in 96.0%, and no surgical approaches such as cricothyroidotomy were used. Mechanical complications occurred in 84 patients, at a rate of 15.9% for nonarrest patients and 8.1% for arrest patients. A wide variety of sedation protocols were used. Difficult intubations (10.8%) were comparable in incidence to the number seen in US emergency departments, not US prehospital systems. By the same token, intubation success rates (99.1%) were comparable to US EDs and much higher than US prehospital results.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe characteristics of French prehospital airway management differ significantly from those of other countries. These differences may be explained by differences in approach to prehospital management rather than differences of skill.\n\n==\n\nRoppolo 1999:\n\nTitle: Nasotracheal intubation in the emergency department, revisited.\n\nAbstract: This retrospective study was designed to investigate the current practice of nasotracheal intubation (NTI) in the Emergency Department (ED) at the University of California, San Diego Medical Center. Over a 5-year period, 21% (105/501) of patients intubated in the ED had at least one NTI attempt. The most frequent primary diagnoses in these patients included drug overdose, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We report an overall NTI success rate of 79% (83/105). Sixty-one percent (64/105) of the patients were nasally intubated on the first NTI attempt. Nasal dilators, topical neosynephrine, and sedation improved NTI success rates. Epistaxis and improper tube position were the most common immediate complications. Sinusitis, pneumonia, and sepsis were the most frequent late complications. Patients receiving thrombolytic therapy were at risk of developing severe epistaxis. A prior history of sinus disease may predispose a nasally intubated patient to sinusitis. The complication rates reported here are similar to those of previous studies. A survey of emergency medicine (EM) residency programs found that EM residents throughout the country perform an average of 2.8 NTIs during their residency training. Thus, there is limited exposure to this intubation technique in EM residency programs. Nasotracheal intubation is a useful alternative to oral intubation, particularly when oral access is compromised. While not the optimal approach, we conclude that NTI is still a valuable method for establishing an airway and should remain among the emergency physician's arsenal of intubation techniques.\n\n==\n\nWalls 2011:\n\nTitle: Emergency airway management: a multi-center report of 8937 emergency department intubations.\n\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nEmergency department (ED) intubation personnel and practices have changed dramatically in recent decades, but have been described only in single-center studies. We sought to better describe ED intubations by using a multi-center registry.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe established a multi-center registry and initiated surveillance of a longitudinal, prospective convenience sample of intubations at 31 EDs. Clinicians filled out a data form after each intubation. Our main outcome measures were descriptive. We characterized indications, methods, medications, success rates, intubator characteristics, and associated event rates. We report proportions with 95% confidence intervals and chi-squared testing; p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 8937 encounters recorded from September 1997 to June 2002. The intubation was performed for medical emergencies in 5951 encounters (67%) and for trauma in 2337 (26%); 649 (7%) did not have a recorded mechanism or indication. Rapid sequence intubation was the initial method chosen in 6138 of 8937 intubations (69%) and in 84% of encounters that involved any intubation medication. The first method chosen was successful in 95%, and intubation was ultimately successful in 99%. Emergency physicians performed 87% of intubations and anesthesiologists 3%. Several other specialties comprised the remaining 10%. One or more associated events were reported in 779 (9%) encounters, with an average of 12 per 100 encounters. No medication errors were reported in 6138 rapid sequence intubations. Surgical airways were performed in 0.84% of all cases and 1.7% of trauma cases.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEmergency physicians perform the vast majority of ED intubations. ED intubation is performed more commonly for medical than traumatic indications. Rapid sequence intubation is the most common method of ED intubation.\n\n==\n\nOkubo 2017:\n\nTitle: The effectiveness of rapid sequence intubation (RSI) versus non-RSI in emergency department: an analysis of multicenter prospective observational study\n\nAbstract: BackgroundAlthough rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is the method of choice in emergency department (ED) airway management, data to support the use of RSI remain scarce. We sought to compare the effectiveness of airway management between RSI and non-RSI (intubation with sedative agents only or without medications) in the ED.MethodsSecondary analysis of the data from a multicenter prospective observational registry at 13 Japanese EDs. All non-cardiac-arrest patients who underwent intubation with RSI or non-RSI were included for the analysis. Outcomes of interest were the success rate of intubation and intubation-related complications.ResultsOf 2365 eligible patients, 761 (32%) underwent intubations with RSI and 1,604 (68%) with non-RSI. Intubations with RSI had a higher success rate on the first attempt compared to those with non-RSI (73 vs. 63%; P\u2009<\u20090.0001). By contrast, the complication rates did not differ significantly between RSI and non-RSI groups (12 vs. 13%; P\u2009=\u20090.59). After adjusting for age, sex, estimated weight, principal indication, device, specialties and training level of the intubator, and clustering of patients within EDs, intubation with RSI was associated with a significantly higher success rate on the first attempt (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.8\u20132.9; P\u2009<\u20090.0001) while that with RSI was not associated with the risk of complications (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6\u20131.2; P\u2009=\u20090.31).ConclusionsIn this large multicenter study of ED airway management, we found that intubation with RSI was independently associated with a higher success rate on the first attempt but not with the risk of complications.", "final_summary": "The use of novel methods versus older methods of intubation in the emergency department and their influence on patient outcomes has been a topic of interest in several studies. \n\nLee (2022) reported that the implementation of a novel emergency response intubation team (ERIT) during the COVID-19 pandemic presented both benefits and challenges. The benefits included increased staff numbers, improved safety, and enhanced intubation expertise. However, challenges such as unfamiliar workflows, role confusion, and communication issues were also noted. \n\nSakles (2019) found that the use of an airway continuous quality improvement (CQI) program significantly improved the safety of rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in the emergency department over a 10-year period. The study reported an increase in first-pass success and a decrease in adverse events. \n\nDriver (2016) compared the success of direct laryngoscopy (DL) and video laryngoscopy (VL) using a C-MAC device in emergency intubations. The study found no significant difference in first-pass success, duration of intubation attempt, aspiration pneumonia, or hospital length of stay between the two methods. \n\nBrown (2015) reported a high and increasing success rate for emergency intubation in the emergency departments studied. The study also noted significant evolution in drug and device selection over the study period. \n\nAdnet (1998) found that the characteristics of French prehospital airway management differed significantly from those of other countries. The study reported a high success rate comparable to U.S. emergency departments and much higher than U.S. prehospital results. \n\nRoppolo (1999) concluded that nasotracheal intubation (NTI), an older method, is still a valuable method for establishing an airway and should remain among the emergency physician's arsenal of intubation techniques. \n\nWalls (2011) found that emergency physicians perform the vast majority of ED intubations and that ED intubation is performed more commonly for medical than traumatic indications. The study also reported a high success rate for RSI, the most common method of ED intubation. \n\nOkubo (2017) found that intubation with RSI was independently associated with a higher success rate on the first attempt but not with the risk of complications. \n\nIn conclusion, the studies collectively suggest that novel methods of intubation in the emergency department, such as the use of an ERIT or an airway CQI program, can improve the success rate of intubation and potentially reduce adverse events. However, older methods like NTI still hold value. The influence of these methods on hospital-, provider-, and patient-level characteristics on patient outcomes appears to be complex and multifaceted, warranting further investigation."}, {"query": "what is the Satir Change Model and its importance for organizational change", "paper_list_string": "Sayles 2002:\n\nTitle: Transformational Change\u2014Based on the Model of Virginia Satir\n\nAbstract: Transformational change using the basic constructs of the Satir Process Model provides a road map for assisting individuals, couples, and families through a transformational shift in their basic belief or understanding of themselves.

This simple yet powerful idea is the ground basis for the work being presented in this paper. This original work brings a new dimension to business modeling: time. Looking at the organization as a dynamic entity that changes through time, allows us to reason over the processes that make the organization evolve, in a formal and objective way. The purpose of this research is to develop tools that help managers to drive business more effectively through time, by keeping in perspective all the issues regarding change in the organization. The first step towards this goal is to create an adequate modeling environment that can be used to represent (1) the organization (at different time frames) and (2) the change processes (that make the organization evolve between time frames). The modeling framework being developed uses UML and, more specifically, the CEO Framework, a business process oriented UML modeling framework. This research is based on a vast theoretical study of process modeling techniques and application domains, as well as on hands-on industry experience in several change processes in real-life companies. The paper presents a formal definition of all the concepts involved in this research, the first version of the UML Profile for Business Change Modeling that is under development and the preliminary results of the application of this research in the Portuguese Army.\n\n==\n\nAppelbaum 1998:\n\nTitle: Strategic organizational change: the role of leadership, learning, motivation and productivity\n\nAbstract: Presents an overview of strategic organizational change (SOC) and its managerial impact on leadership, learning, motivation and productivity. Theoretical and empirical data presented are: the sources and determinants of strategic organizational change; the management implications of SOC; organizational leadership within the context of SOC; learning aspects of SOC; the impact of SOC on organizational and individual productivity; a model that explains the relationships between SOC, leadership, learning, motivation and productivity. Depicts strategic organizational change as an integrative process with all organizational elements such as human resources, systems and technologies being considered for successful change to occur. The proposed model for strategic organizational change is an attempt to link the software and hardware components of organizations. In view of the pressures being expected from the external environment and the critical vision of organizations, research suggests that top management needs to establish a flexible and adaptive infrastructure that should lead contemporary and complex organizations to optimum levels of performance.

We observe an acceleration of change in the value systems worldwide, an adoption of new attitudes, new goals, and aspects leading to rapid change of the society. To survive and develop, an organization must first know how to anticipate and capitalize on the opportunities and to attenuate or eliminate the vulnerabilities. Second, the organization must demonstrate the ability to effectively manage the change process, from detailed investigation of its past and present. These are the fundamental premises on which the change management is based. The research and practice of the change management models summarize a basis for understanding the change processes and mechanisms at both organizational and individual levels. In the following we will present some change management models that may be useful in managing change in economic organizations and whose applicability and implementation proved to be effective for identifying outcomes of change in organizations.\n\n==\n\nParry 2014:\n\nTitle: Empirical Development of a Model of Performance Drivers in Organizational Change Projects\n\nAbstract: In order to investigate the drivers that impact on the success of change projects, a major research project was commenced in 1998. Extensive quantitative studies of organizational change processes were conducted across industries, countries and companies, in order to establish the determinants of successful change projects. This article presents the initial step in this project, the development of a descriptive model that provides the basis for the assessment of change projects and the analysis of interactions between key success factors and performance outcomes. Forty-four survey questions were put to 117,355 employees involved in or affected by organizational change. The results of factor analyses were used to guide the development of a descriptive model of the drivers of performance in organizational change projects. This article presents the results of the factor analyses, and the ChangeTracking model that has been developed. The ChangeTracking model consists of: two outcome variables, realizing business benefits and business performance; and six key drivers, the amount of change and turbulence, available resources, alignment with the company's vision and direction, quality of change management, work roles and emotional energy. The ChangeTracking model provides an empirically derived model of change management to guide future research and practice.", "final_summary": "The Satir Change Model, developed by Virginia Satir, is a five-stage process that describes the effects of change on individuals and groups. It provides a roadmap for transformational shifts in understanding and self-perception (Sayles, 2002). \n\nThe model's stages include Late Status Quo, Resistance, Chaos, Integration, and New Status Quo. It emphasizes the importance of self-esteem and self-accountability in navigating change, suggesting that transformation is an internal process where individuals can fulfill their universal yearnings for love, acknowledgment, and acceptance (Sayles, 2002). \n\nWhile the Satir Change Model focuses on individual change, other models such as Kurt Lewin's Change Model and the Transtheoretical Model provide frameworks for organizational change (Hussain, 2018; Prochaska, 2004). These models highlight the importance of leadership and employee involvement in successful change implementation (Appelbaum, 1998; Hussain, 2016). \n\nDespite the variety of models available, the Satir Change Model stands out for its focus on the individual's internal experience of change. This focus on the individual can be particularly useful in managing the human aspects of change, which are often the most challenging (Appelbaum, 1998). \n\nIn conclusion, while the Satir Change Model provides a valuable framework for understanding individual change, other models like Kurt Lewin's and the Transtheoretical Model offer comprehensive strategies for managing organizational change. The focus on the individual's internal experience of change in the Satir Model sets it apart from other models and highlights the importance of addressing human aspects in change management."}, {"query": "Rent-seeking behaviour, where companies seek preferential treatment, further diverts resources to less productive uses. The cumulative impact of these distortions significantly reduces overall productivity. Government intervention and ownership contribute to resource allocation distortions by favouring politically connected firms and sectors over more productive ones (Zhang 2021). Consequently, resources tend to flow towards less efficient state-owned enterprises and politically motivated projects, hindering productivity and hindering economic growth (Nicola 2020).", "paper_list_string": "Deacon 2015:\n\nTitle: Rent seeking and the resource curse\n\nAbstract: Many countries receiving natural resource windfalls suffer from slow growth, low incomes and weak political institutions, an empirical regularity dubbed the resource curse. Patterns in the data suggest a political link is involved: some countries escape this fate, those that succumb generally have weak institutions initially, and a curse is most likely when the resource is spatially concentrated. Rentseeking for a resource prize is a prominent theme in theoretical explanations of the curse. While the precise mechanisms vary, several postulate that rent-seeking diverts activity or resources away from productive employment, e.g., private capital may be shifted to a less productive but secure sector, potential entrepreneurs may be attracted into rent-seeking rather than wealth creation, labor may be diverted away from producing output and toward competing for a resource rent prize. While empirical results remain somewhat controversial, there is now extensive evidence supporting both the curse and a political transmission channel. Three aspects of this work are particularly important for rent-seeking: (i) political theories of the resource curse consistently predict more than 100 percent dissipation of the resource windfall, a finding at odds with theoretical treatments of rentseeking; (ii) variations in pre-windfall political institutions can magnify, moderate of overturn the resource curse effect; and (iii) a resource windfall can alter the quality of political institutions.\n\n==\n\nMurphy 1993:\n\nTitle: Why Is Rent-Seeking So Costly to Growth?\n\nAbstract: Economists from Adam Smith (1776) to Douglass C. North (1981) agree that poor protection of property rights is bad for growth. But why is this problem so severe? Why do Peru (Hernando De Soto, 1989) and Equatorial Guinea (Robert Klitgaard, 1990) fail to grow at all when public and private rent-seeking make property insecure? In this paper, we explore two reasons why rent-seeking, meaning any redistributive activity that takes up resources, is so costly to growth. First, rent-seeking activities exhibit very natural increasing returns. That is, an increase in rent-seeking activity may make rent-seeking more (rather than less) attractive relative to productive activity. This condition can lead to multiple equilibria in the economy, with \"bad\" equilibria exhibiting very high levels of rent-seeking and low output.l Second, rent-seeking, particularly public rent-seeking by government officials, is likely to hurt innovative activities more than everyday production. Since innovation drives economic growth, public rent-seeking hampers growth more severely than production.\n\n==\n\nEsteban 2006:\n\nTitle: Inequality, Lobbying and Resource Allocation\n\nAbstract: This paper describes how wealth inequality may distort public resource allocation. A government seeks to allocate limited resources to productive sectors, but sectoral productivity is privately known by agents with vested interests in those sectors. They lobby the government for preferential treatment. The government\u2014even if it honestly seeks to maximize economic efficiency\u2014may be confounded by the possibility that both high wealth and true economic desirability create loud lobbies. Broadly speaking, both poorer economies and unequal economies display greater public misallocation. The paper warns against the conventional wisdom that this is so because such governments are more \"corrupt.\"\n\n==\n\nKurer 1993:\n\nTitle: Clientelism, corruption, and the allocation of resources\n\nAbstract: ConclusionCorruption has been shown to have more serious effects upon allocation than simply drawing resources into rent-seeking activities. If politicians anticipate gains from corruption in the policy making process, sub-optimal policies will be the result. Typical examples include excessive nationalization of industry, excessive regulation of the private sector through practices such as licensing and quotas with a view to extract the rent created by these measures. In addition, further misallocation will result at the execution state. It has been shown that the revisionists were wrong in assuming that licenses and contracts will be allocated to the most efficient producers, that rent will be eliminated in government employment, and that corruption increases the efficiency of the bureaucracy. Moreover, differential access to government services leads to additional allocative losses.\n\n==\n\nNgo 2008:\n\nTitle: Rent-seeking and economic governance in the structural nexus of corruption in China\n\nAbstract: This article examines the sources of widespread rent-seeking practices and their relations to corruption in China. It argues that rent-creation and seeking are difficult to eliminate because they have become institutionalized as the constitutive parts of economic governance. Using case studies drawn from a number of industrial sectors, this study shows that the creation and allocation of economic rents has become a major policy instrument used by various levels of governments to manoeuvre industrial plans and development priorities. At the same time, the discretionary power exercised by state agents in implementing development priorities has created mounting opportunities for exchanging rents with bribes. The result is a structural nexus between economic governance, rent-seeking and corruption that defy administrative measures aiming at achieving a clean government in China.\n\n==\n\nScharfstein 1997:\n\nTitle: The Dark Side of Internal Capital Markets: Divisional Rent-Seeking and Inefficient Investment\n\nAbstract: We develop a two-tiered agency model that shows how rent-seeking behavior on the part of division managers can subvert the workings of an internal capital market. By rent-seeking, division managers can raise their bargaining power and extract greater overall compensation from the CEO. And because the CEO is herself an agent of outside investors, this extra compensation may take the form not of cash wages, but rather of preferential capital budgeting allocations. One interesting feature of our model is that it implies a kind of \u201csocialism\u201d in internal capital allocation, whereby weaker divisions get subsidized by stronger ones.\n\n==\n\nZhang 2007:\n\nTitle: Incremental Reform and Distortions in China\u2019s Product and Factor Markets\n\nAbstract: The purpose of economic reform is to reduce distortions and enhance efficiency. However, when reforms are partial and incremental, individuals and local governments are often able to capture the rent inherent in the gradual transition process. Young (2000) warned that such rent-seeking behavior might lead to increasing market fragmentation. Empirical studies have shown the opposite in the product market. This article argues that as the rent from China\u2019s product market has been squeezed out due to deepening reforms, rent-seeking behavior may have shifted to the capital market. Further reforms are needed in the capital market to squeeze out these rent-seeking opportunities, just as those from the product and labor markets were squeezed out earlier.\n\n==\n\nAuty 2000:\n\nTitle: Political economy of resource abundant states\n\nAbstract: Natural resource-abundance tends to undermine investment efficiency whereas a resource-poor endowment places a premium on efficiency. The type of political state provides the link between the natural resource endowment and the economic outcome. Developmental political states tend to be associated with resource-poor countries, albeit not exclusively so. Their governments pursue a coherent economic policy that maximizes social welfare. Resource-poor countries with developmental states industrialize early and follow a competitive industrialization model that sustains rapid and egalitarian growth. In resource abundant countries, contests for rents generate factional and predatory states that distribute the rents through indirect means that distort the economy. The most likely result is a growth collapse, recovery from which may take decades.", "final_summary": "The body of research paints a vivid picture of the negative impacts of rent-seeking behaviour on economic productivity and growth. Rent-seeking, as described by Deacon (2015), Murphy (1993), and others, is the pursuit of wealth without creating new wealth, often through manipulation of the economic environment. This behaviour is particularly prevalent in resource-rich environments and can lead to significant distortions in resource allocation and overall productivity (Deacon, 2015; Auty, 2000).\n\nMurphy (1993) underscores the inherent inefficiencies of rent-seeking. He suggests that rent-seeking activities exhibit increasing returns, making them more attractive than productive activities, and disproportionately harm innovative activities, which are crucial for economic growth. Esteban (2006) adds a different dimension to the discussion, illustrating how wealth inequality can distort public resource allocation, leading to greater public misallocation in poorer and unequal economies.\n\nGovernment intervention and ownership can further amplify these distortions. Zhang (2021) and Nicola (2020) argue that government favouritism towards politically connected firms and sectors can divert resources towards less efficient state-owned enterprises and politically motivated projects. This is echoed by Kurer (1993), who suggests that corruption can lead to sub-optimal policies and further misallocation. Ngo (2008) provides a case study of China, where rent-seeking and corruption have become institutionalized parts of economic governance, leading to widespread inefficiencies.\n\nThe research also highlights the role of internal capital markets in perpetuating rent-seeking behaviour. Scharfstein (1997) presents a model where division managers can extract greater compensation from CEOs through rent-seeking, leading to preferential capital budgeting allocations. Zhang (2007) suggests that as rent-seeking opportunities in product markets are reduced through reforms, rent-seeking behaviour may shift to capital markets, necessitating further reforms.\n\nIn conclusion, the body of research strongly suggests that rent-seeking behaviour, exacerbated by government intervention, corruption, and internal capital market dynamics, can lead to significant distortions in resource allocation, reducing overall productivity and hindering economic growth. Therefore, addressing rent-seeking behaviour and its underlying causes is crucial for enhancing economic efficiency and growth."}, {"query": "access to primary health care for diabetes West Africa", "paper_list_string": "Nielsen 2017:\n\nTitle: Accessing diabetes care in rural Uganda: Economic and social resources\n\nAbstract: ABSTRACT Non-communicable diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) are increasing rapidly in most Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries like Uganda. Little attention has been given to how patients with T2D try to achieve treatment when the availability of public health care for their disease is limited, as is the case in most SSA countries. In this paper we focus on the landscape of availability of care and the therapeutic journeys of patients within that landscape.

We analyse the resources patients need to use the available treatment options, and demonstrate that the patients\u2019 journeys to access and maintain treatment are facilitated by the knowledge and support of their therapy management groups. Patients access treatment more effectively, if they and their family have money, useful social relations, and knowledge, together with the capacity to communicate with health staff.

In Malawi, it is estimated that diabetes prevalence rate is 5.6% among the age group 25-64 in the year 2009. In Malawi, diabetes has not gained adequate attention in terms of all resources such as personnel, medicinal and laboratory equipment and reagents. Primary Health Care approach to the management of diabetes is not only low labour intensive but improves patient retention as well especially in rural areas. Health Education, for instance, improves self- care and life style. Adopting this strategy will help poor Malawians affected with diabetes access the much needed care affordably.

WHO estimated the number of cases of diabetics in Ethiopia to be about 800,000 in 2000, and projected that it would increase to about 1.8 million by the year 2030. Care for diabetic patients may require close and sustained support from a health care team, adequate financial resources, and advanced patient knowledge and motivation. In this respect, there is lack of information in the country. Objective : This study was conducted with the aim of assessing the characteristics of the health care system for diabetic patients, how diabetic patients are cared for including medical care and adequacy of facilities for the prevention of complications and outcomes at primary health care and secondary health care levels. Methods : An assessment of the characteristics of the health care system (structure) for diabetic patients was conducted in 21 health centres (primary health care level) and 5 regional hospitals (secondary health care level) in Addis Ababa. Furthermore, a total of 106 diabetic patients drawn from six out of the 21 health centres and another 123 diabetic patients drawn from three of the six hospitals were consecutively interviewed. Results : All the Regional hospitals and one of the health centres were running established diabetic referral clinics. Similarly, a lack of professionals was observed in all the health institutions in general and the health centres, in particular. Only 21% of patients had access for blood glucose monitoring at the same health institutions. The emphasis given for diabetic education (24%) was less than expected. Only 11 (5%) of diabetic patients were able to do self blood glucose monitoring at home. Fifty one percents of patients didn't have urine analysis, BUN, creatinine and lipid profile in the previous 1-2 years. None of diabetic patients had haemoglobin Alc (HbA1c) determination. Nearly 75% of the patients required admissions directly or indirectly due to uncontrolled diabetes. About 87% of the diabetics had regular follow ups at their respective health centres and hospitals. Hypertension (34%), diabetes related eye disease (33%) and renal disease (21%) were the major associated illnesses observed among the diabetics. Sixty-six patients (23%) had a total of about 131 admissions. Conclusion : Although there is a well-established health infrastructure for diabetics care in Addis Ababa, the diabetic care is below the acceptable standard. The finding of this study may, thus, help to clarify issues related to potential changes in the health care system dealing with diabetes and for strengthening the referral system for diabetes health care.

Random blood glucose, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and urine albumin/creatinine ratio were assayed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAcceptable glycaemic control (HbA1c < 2% above normal population range) was found in only 15.7% of subjects (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.4-20.8%). Mean HbA1c was 11.3%. The prevalence of hypertension (blood pressure > or = 160/95 mmHg and/or prescribed antihypertensive medication) was 65.4% (CI: 59.0-71.1%). Of 129 patients who were prescribed antihypertensives, 14.0% (CI: 8.5-21.2%) were normotensive (< 140/90 mmHg). Severe obesity was present in 36.5% (CI: 30.4-42.9%). Rates of attendance for review and compliance with diabetic medications were high. Blood glucose monitoring was not regularly performed and medications were rarely modified. Complications were common and mostly undiagnosed. Retinopathy of any grade was found in 40.3% of patients (CI: 33.2-50.9%) and was severe enough to warrant laser photocoagulation in 11.1% (CI: 8.5-21.2%). Microalbuminuria was found in 46.4% (CI: 40.0-53.0%) and foot abnormalities attributable to diabetes in 6.0% (CI: 3.4-9.7%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCare and control of diabetes in this rural community is suboptimal. There is a need for primary care staff to focus on modifying prescriptions in the face of poor blood glucose control and/or uncontrolled hypertension. Additional training and support for nursing staff and education for patients will be central to achieving this level of intervention.\n\n==\n\nWhiting 2003:\n\nTitle: Challenges to Health Care for Diabetes in Africa\n\nAbstract: The aim of this review is to summarize the contextual, clinical and health system challenges to the delivery of health care for diabetes in Africa.

With diverse health challenges, health authorities in Sub-Saharan Africa and international donors need robust data on the epidemiology and impact of diabetes in order to plan and prioritise their health programmes. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the epidemiological trends and public health implications of diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa.MethodsWe conducted a systematic literature review of papers published on diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa 1999-March 2011, providing data on diabetes prevalence, outcomes (chronic complications, infections, and mortality), access to diagnosis and care and economic impact.ResultsType 2 diabetes accounts for well over 90% of diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa, and population prevalence proportions ranged from 1% in rural Uganda to 12% in urban Kenya. Reported type 1 diabetes prevalence was low and ranged from 4 per 100,000 in Mozambique to 12 per 100,000 in Zambia. Gestational diabetes prevalence varied from 0% in Tanzania to 9% in Ethiopia. Proportions of patients with diabetic complications ranged from 7-63% for retinopathy, 27-66% for neuropathy, and 10-83% for microalbuminuria. Diabetes is likely to increase the risk of several important infections in the region, including tuberculosis, pneumonia and sepsis. Meanwhile, antiviral treatment for HIV increases the risk of obesity and insulin resistance. Five-year mortality proportions of patients with diabetes varied from 4-57%. Screening studies identified high proportions (> 40%) with previously undiagnosed diabetes, and low levels of adequate glucose control among previously diagnosed diabetics. Barriers to accessing diagnosis and treatment included a lack of diagnostic tools and glucose monitoring equipment and high cost of diabetes treatment. The total annual cost of diabetes in the region was estimated at US$67.03 billion, or US$8836 per diabetic patient.ConclusionDiabetes exerts a significant burden in the region, and this is expected to increase. Many diabetic patients face significant challenges accessing diagnosis and treatment, which contributes to the high mortality and prevalence of complications observed. The significant interactions between diabetes and important infectious diseases highlight the need and opportunity for health planners to develop integrated responses to communicable and non-communicable diseases.", "final_summary": "Access to primary health care for diabetes in West Africa is a complex issue, influenced by a myriad of factors. \n\nNielsen (2017) highlights the importance of economic and social resources in accessing diabetes care in rural Uganda.

Crane operators work in a fixed posture characterized by a flexed position of the cervical spine, isometric load of the extensor cervical muscles and increased dorsal kyphosis. The prevalence of spinal disorders was 39.7% for the cervical tract, 37.2% for the dorsal tract and 38.5% for the lumbar region. The results were compared with those concerning a control group. A statistically significant difference was found in the number of cervical and dorsal complaints (O.R. = 3.33 and 2.69), whereas the difference was nearly significant for the lumbar tract (O.R. = 1.65). The results suggest that this category of workers may be subject to an increased risk for the spine.\n\n==\n\nHagberg 1987:\n\nTitle: Prevalence rates and odds ratios of shoulder-neck diseases in different occupational groups.\n\nAbstract: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association and impact of occupational exposure and diseases of the shoulder and neck. Prevalence rates, odds ratios, aetiological fractions, and their confidence intervals were computed for pooled and non-pooled data of previous published reports. By comparison with office workers and farmers, dentists had an increased odds ratio for cervical spondylosis (two studies) and for shoulder joint osteoarthrosis. Meat carriers, miners, and \"heavy workers\" also had significantly higher rates of cervical spondylosis compared with referents. Compared with iron foundry workers, civil servants had a significant odds ratio (4.8) of cervical disc disease and a 0.79 aetiological fraction. Whether this was due to exposure or healthy worker effect was not clear. In four occupational groups with high shoulder-neck load an odds ratio of 4.0 was found for thoracic outlet syndrome with an aetiological fraction of 0.75. Rotator cuff tendinitis in occupational groups with work at shoulder level (two studies) showed an odds ratio of 11 and an aetiological fraction of 0.91. Keyboard operators had an odds ratio of 3.0 for tension neck syndrome (five studies). Unfortunately, owing to the scanty description of the work task, the exposure could be analysed only by job title. Examination of published reports shows clearly that certain job titles are associated with shoulder-neck disorders. High rates and aetiological fractions for rotator cuff tendinitis and tension neck syndrome suggest that preventive measures could be effective. Although job descriptions are brief, the associations noted suggest that highly repetitive shoulder muscle contractions, static contractions, and work at shoulder level are hazardous exposure factors. In reports of cross sectional studies of occupational shoulder-neck disorders presentation of age, exposure, and effect distribution may help for future meta-analysis.\n\n==\n\n\u00c5lund 1992:\n\nTitle: Work-related chronic neck impairment. Neck motion analysis in female traverse crane operators.\n\nAbstract: Twenty-one female steel industry traverse crane operators with long-term sick-leave (3 (1-8) years) due to chronic neck disability underwent careful analysis of case history, physical status and electrogoniometric three-dimensional recordings of active neck motion. Results were compared with those from working female crane operators having identical work posture and tasks and, further, with a group of working female clerks. The sick-listed crane operators had previous frequent contacts with the primary health care because of complaints from the neck and back. In comparison with the reference groups, the sick-listed crane operators showed tenderness of the trapezius and levator scapulae muscles and a short neck stature in combination with impaired active neck motion range with reduced motion speed. The motion pattern was however unchanged. The findings are consistent with the clinical picture of chronic neck myalgia that persisted despite long-term absence from the previous exposure to high static work load upon the neck-shoulders.\n\n==\n\nNourollahi-Darabad 2017:\n\nTitle: Full shift assessment of back and head postures in overhead crane operators with and without symptoms\n\nAbstract: Prolonged sitting with a flexed back and neck is recognized as being associated with an increased risk of neck and back pain disorders among overhead crane operators.

In a single blinded procedure, quantified cervical clinical tests were performed on machine operators with and without subjective reports of neck pain. Objectives. To evaluate whether subjective reports of neck pain are associated with limited and painful cervical spine mobility. Summary of Background Data. Spinal motion evaluation and pain rating are commonly used for assessing impairment in patients with spinal disorders. However, it is still unclear how cervical spinal motion and corresponding pain rating are affected by subjective reports of neck pain. Methods. Forty-nine male forest machine operators completed the Standardized Nordic questionnaire on musculoskeletal symptoms. Maximal voluntary cervical spinal flexion-extension, bilateral axial rotation, and lateral flexion were measured with a goniometer ad modum Myrin, while corresponding pain was rated on Borg's scale. Results. Nineteen men (38.8%) reported no neck pain within the past 12 months, nine men (18.4%) reported pain during the past 12 months (but not during the past 7 days), and 21 men (42.8%) had experienced neck pain during the past 7 days. The results of two of the range-of-motion tests (flexion and left axial rotation) and three of the pain ratings (during flexion, extension, and left axial rotation) differed significantly between men who reported pain the past 7 days and those with no pain, and they correlated significantly with the severity of pain as reported in the questionnaire. Conclusions. Many forest machine operators reporting neck pain in the Nordic questionnaire did have limited and painful cervical spine mobility. Range-of-motion tests may be useful tools to describe impairment and constitute a basis for assessment for therapeutic interventions.\n\n==\n\nLuoma 1998:\n\nTitle: Lumbar disc degeneration in relation to occupation.\n\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES\nThe aim was to study risk factors of lumbar disc degeneration demonstrable with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with special emphasis on occupational load and back accidents.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe subjects in this cross-sectional study were 53 machine drivers, 51 construction carpenters, and 60 municipal office workers aged 40-45 years. Data on possible risk factors were available from current structured questionnaires and for 4 and 7 years in retrospect. The prevalence of lumbar disc degeneration L2/L3-L5/S1 was determined with MRI.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAn increased risk was found for posterior disc bulges among the carpenters and for anterior disc bulges among the machine drivers, but decreased signal intensity was not related to occupation. Car driving was also associated with anterior disc bulges. All signs of disc degeneration were related to a history of back accidents. Disc degeneration was not related to body height, overweight, smoking, or the frequency of physical exercise.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOccupational load affects the risk of disc degeneration of the lumbar spine. Accidental back injuries and motor vehicle driving are associated with an increased risk of disc degeneration. Anterior and posterior disc bulges seem to be related to different types of physical loads.\n\n==\n\nMaimaiti 2019:\n\nTitle: Cervical musculoskeletal disorders and their relationships with personal and work-related factors among electronic assembly workers.\n\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION\nElectronics assembly workers are reported to have a high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). This study investigated the prevalence of cervical MSDs and the complex relationships between cervical MSDs and individual, physical, psychosocial factors among electronics assembly workers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this cross-sectional survey, self-administered questionnaires from 700 workers in electronics manufacturing workshops were analysed. Information concerning musculoskeletal symptoms, personal and work-related factors was collected. Finally, the prevalence of cervical MSDs was computed for different subgroups, and the relationships with different factors were analyzed using logistic regression and structural equation modeling (SEM).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe total 12\u202fmonth prevalence of cervical MSDs among the survey population was 29.4%. Variables of gender, job tenure, twisting head frequently, neck flexion/extension for long time and work required to be done quickly showed significant associations with MSDs in a multivariate logistic regression (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). The SEM analysis showed moderate and significant correlations between postural load (\u03b3\u202f=\u202f0.279), gender (\u03b3\u202f=\u202f0.233) and cervical MSDs, while there were weak but significant correlations between vibration (\u03b3\u202f=\u202f0.024), work stress (\u03b3\u202f=\u202f0.126), job tenure (\u03b3\u202f=\u202f0.024) and cervical MSDs. Both work stress and vibration affected the MSDs indirectly through postural load.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe logistic regression results support previous general epidemiological MSD studies, and indicates that individual, physical, and psychosocial factors are related to cervical MSDs. The SEM provides a better approximation of the complexity of the relationship between risk factors and cervical MSDs. Improving awkward postures may be effective ways to control the influence of occupational stressors or vibration on MSDs. Practical Applications: The study is to improve prevention of MSDs among electronics assembly workers and promote their occupational health.\n\n==\n\nBurdorf 1990:\n\nTitle: An epidemiological study of low-back pain in crane operators.\n\nAbstract: A survey among workers in a steel factory was conducted to determine the risk for low-back pain (LBP) among male crane operators. Crane operators (n = 33) were matched for age with male control workers (n = 30) and examined for frequency and nature of LBP by the on-site medical service. Comparison between crane operators and controls showed a statistically significant odds ratio for LBP of 3.6. Although crane operators had been exposed more often to backstraining factors in previous occupations, in the employed logistic analysis only their current job explained the elevated occurrence of LBP. It is suggested that workers in sedentary position with exposure to whole-body vibration are at special risk for LBP. The results of this study provide evidence to strongly recommend persons with a history of back complaints not to seek employment as crane operators.", "final_summary": "The relationship between cervical disc pathology and occupation as a crane operator is a topic of considerable interest in occupational health research.

Similarly, \u00c5lund (1992) reported chronic neck impairment in female crane operators, characterized by impaired neck motion range and reduced motion speed. Nourollahi-Darabad (2017) also highlighted the association between prolonged sitting with a flexed back and neck, a common posture for crane operators, and an increased risk of neck and back pain disorders.\n\nHagberg (1987) found associations between certain job titles, including dentists, meat carriers, miners, and \"heavy workers,\" and shoulder-neck disorders such as cervical spondylosis and shoulder joint osteoarthrosis.

The nature of the work, particularly the static postures and whole-body vibrations, appears to contribute to an increased risk of spinal disorders, including those in the cervical region.

Here we describe an open-source platform, the ImpedanceAnalyzer, for easy-to-use physics-based analysis of experimental EIS spectra. To demonstrate the use of the platform, we explore the basic capabilities of the pseudo two-dimensional (P2D) battery model to predict publicly available experimental EIS data from a 1500 mAh commercial lithium-ion (LiCoO 2 /graphite) cell. An a priori computed dataset of 38,800 P2D-based impedance spectra simulations, covering a wide range of frequencies (1 mHz to 100 kHz) and model parameters, enables a straightforward least squares matching approach for analyzing experimental spectra. We \ufb01nd an average error of 1.73% between the best-matching computed spectrum from the 38,800 member library and the experimental spectrum being analyzed. Our analysis shows there is signi\ufb01cant opportunity to improve the \ufb01t between experimental data and physics-based impedance simulations by a combination of a larger computed dataset, local optimization, and further additions to the model physics.

In this study, combining graphical analysis of impedance data in both Bode and Nyquist plots, a two-step procedure is proposed to address the challenges: (1) a frequency derivative phase angle method is developed in Bode plot to identify the number of time constants (or electrochemical processes); (2) graphical analysis of impedance data in Nyquist plot is used sequentially for initial parameter determination. Major graphical analysis methods are compared in terms of frequency resolution, accuracy and complexity using synthetic data.

The advantages of EIS for kinetic and mechanism analysis include the fact that it is a steady state technique, that it employs small signal analysis, and that it is capable of probing relaxations over a very wide frequency range ( 1 MHz) using readily available instrumentation. EIS also has an enormous advantage over classical transient techniques in that the validity of the data is readily checked using the Kramers-Kronig transforms. The principal disadvantage of the method is that many workers are discouraged by the level of mathematics required to properly analyze impedance data. This has led many researchers to analyze their data in terms of simple equivalent electrical circuits, and hence to ignore the great power of EIS for deriving mechanistic and kinetic information for processes that occur at electrochemical interfaces.\n\n==\n\nPopkirov 1993:\n\nTitle: Validation of experimental data in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy\n\nAbstract: Abstract Fe, Ag and polymer coated Pt electrodes were investigated using a FFT impedance spectrometer which operates with a sum of properly defined sine waves as a perturbation. Based on an analysis of the discrete response spectra, it is possible to discuss the validation of the measured impedance data. New frequencies are observed in a number of cases, and their distribution gives information about possible causes for impedance spectrum distortion, eg about a poor linearity and/or instability of the electrode interphase during the measurement. In some cases it is possible to correct the measured data in order to obtain valid impedance spectra.\n\n==\n\nWit 1996:\n\nTitle: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy as a tool to obtain mechanistic information on the passive behaviour of aluminium\n\nAbstract: Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy can be used very effectively for studies regarding the passivity of metals. In general there are two different methods to interpret measured impedance data. The first method uses electrical equivalent circuits. Alternatively a transfer function can be calculated, ie a theoretical impedance expression based on an assumed physical model. The latter method is a more fundamental approach but often corroding systems including passive alloys are too complicated to arrive at useful transfer functions. In that case the impedance data are in general analysed according to the first method. An equivalent circuit is fitted to the measurement data. For some cases the transfer function can be derived and analysed, when accepting some approximations. As an example the passive behavior of aluminium will be discussed.\n\n==\n\nMcintyre 1996:\n\nTitle: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; a tool for organic coatings optimizations\n\nAbstract: Abstract Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied to the optimization of automotive electrodeposited coatings, container interior coatings and industrial maintenance coatings. The electrochemical impedance data were used to predict corrosion protection, film porosity, solution absorption into the coatings and film delamination properties. Variables such as resin contents, crosslink densities, cure temperatures, and solvent types and contents were evaluated for these various types of coatings. In general the electrochemical impedance data correlated well with conventional exposure tests results such as salt fog, cyclic scab corrosion and delamination tests. The impedance spectra permits a rather rapid (15\u201375 min per sample) assessment of the film's characteristics even when no visually observable changes have occurred. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy provides a technique to optimize coatings while reducing the time of coating evaluations and gives insight into the chemical and physical properties of the coatings.\n\n==\n\nKuipers 2020:\n\nTitle: An Algorithm for an Online Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and Battery Parameter Estimation: Development, Verification and Validation\n\nAbstract: Abstract More advanced battery diagnostic approaches are required for a safer and more reliable operation of today's and future battery technologies. For the purpose of evaluating a battery's internal conditions, Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful tool, but nowadays it is only used in laboratory setups. It could provide valuable information about the battery's internal states, if instead it is applied online in an actual battery application. Therefore, we have developed an efficient algorithm, which is designed to run on a battery management system continuously carrying out measurements of the electrochemical impedance by iteratively evaluating measurements of battery current and voltage. Furthermore, the algorithm adapts the parameters of an equivalent circuit model to best match the battery's impedance, hence providing characteristic measures of a battery's internal conditions. The algorithm is implemented in a generic form, which severs as a baseline that can be adjusted to more specific requirements and circumstances in corresponding battery applications. The scope of this work focuses on an introduction of the generic algorithm as well as a proof-of-concept. The later was carried out in two steps. First, the algorithm was run against a battery model. Subsequently, the algorithm was validated utilizing measurements from a real battery cell. In this case, laboratory electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements served as reference. The algorithm was able to estimate impedance with a high accuracy in both tests. A high accuracy was also achieved for the parameter estimation; however, its accuracy decreases with large superposed DC current rates.", "final_summary": "Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful tool in the analysis of electrochemical systems, with a focus on automated analysis.

The model considers the benefit and cost of avoiding the activity, the probability that the activity is unsafe, and scientific tests or studies that could be conducted to revise the probability that the activity is unsafe. For a single decision maker, thresholds are identified for his or her current subjective probability that the activity is unsafe. These thresholds indicate whether the preferred course of action is avoiding the activity without further study, engaging in the activity without further study, or conducting a test or research programme to obtain additional information and following the result. When these thresholds are low, precautionary action is more likely to be warranted. When there are multiple stakeholders, differences in their perceptions of the benefit and cost of avoidance and differences in their perceptions of the accuracy of the additional information provided by the test or research programme combine to create differences in their decision thresholds. Thus, the model allows for the rational expression of differences among parties in a way that highlights disagreements and possible paths to conflict resolution. The model is illustrated with an application to phytosanitary standards in international trade and examined in terms of recent empirical research on lay perceptions of risks, benefits, and trust.

Two software models for environmental risk assessment of industrial activities are available, VERIS and RISAM. At present, these models are being integrated in one comprehensive model. The results of the new model can be used as a starting-point for preventive, repressive or mitigating measures, as well as for a basis of a risk management system.

It basically consists of evaluating the risks involved in the execution of working activities, so as to provide the managers with information suitable to address intervention measures. The most important activity in risk assessment is the risk evaluation task but, despite its importance, national and international regulations have never formalized a standard methodology for addressing it, leaving companies complete freedom to adopt the approach they consider appropriate. As a consequence, companies generally settle on the use of simple methodologies which frequently are not able to emphasize all the main aspects affecting risk in the workplace and to produce a precise ranking of hazardous activities. In this paper, a new methodology for risk evaluation is then proposed with the aim to overcome limitations of the classical approaches. In particular, new factors are introduced to take into account effects of human behavior and environment on risk level, other than the classical injury magnitude and occurrence probability of an accident. The proposed methodology also integrates an estimative approach based on the fuzzy logic theory, which permits more coherence in the evaluation process, producing a very suitable final rank of hazardous activities. Finally, an actual case study is reported to show the capabilities of the new risk evaluation model.\n\n==\n\nPhillips 2012:\n\nTitle: Predicting the risk of future dangerousness.\n\nAbstract: The purpose of assessing dangerousness is to determine whether an individual poses a risk of endangering self or others now or in the near future and to identify what interventions are necessary to minimize that risk.\n\n==\n\nTrbojevic 2005:\n\nTitle: Risk criteria in EU\n\nAbstract: This paper focuses on risk criteria used in the EU for population living in vicinity of hazardous facilities. The criteria vary from fully risk-based and goal setting to the prescriptive consequence based criteria. In spite of the philosophical differences in the formulation of risk criteria, there is a single EU Directive (Seveso 2) on the control of major accident hazards involving chemicals which applies to every member state and clearly the level of safety across the EU should be very similar if not the same. Therefore the first aim of the paper was to minimise the differences between the variety of safety approaches across the EU in order to develop risk acceptance criteria with the potential to converge to a unified set. The second aim was to develop societal risk criteria completely consistent with the legally applied individual risk criteria. public is As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) publishes from time to time the risk levels it considers as intolerable or tolerable under certain circumstances and while these risk levels cover all industrial activities in the UK, the primary instrument for risk control is ALARP dynamics. Table 1 Comparison of Individual Risk Criteria IRPA UK The Netherlands Hungary Czech Republic 10 Intolerable limit for members of the public 10 Risk has to be reduced to the level As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) Limit for existing installations. ALARA principle applies Upper limit Limit for existing installations. Risk reduc tion must be carried out 3 x 10 LUP limit of acceptability (converted from risk of dangerous dose of 3 x 10) 10 Broadly acceptable level of risk Limit for the new installations and general limit after 2010. ALARA applies Lower limit Limit for the new installations 10 Negligible level of risk 10 Negligible level of risk The situation in other countries is not very clear; for example in the Netherlands, two regions Rijmond and Schiphol are excluded from the new criteria (in force after 2010), while if there is a lower risk situation than the norms require, the Authorities can allow building up to the norm; the enforcement of ALARA is questionable. It can be seen from Table 1 that individual risk of 10 per year represents the upper limit in Europe for existing installations, while in the UK the intolerable limit is 10 but ALARP is strictly imposed, meaning that in reality the risk is well below the limit. The upper limit for individual risk for new installations in Czech Republic and in the Netherlands after 2010 is 10 per year. It should also be noted that the individual risk in the LUP guidelines in the UK, HSE 2004a, in terms of a dangerous dose of 3 x 10 per year can be converted to individual risk of death of 3 x 10 per year. The quoted value for the Netherlands (10 and 10) represent so called location risk (risk contour), or the individual risk to a person who is permanently at the particular location. In addition, in the case of the Netherlands, the risk value corresponds to one establishment (facility), and the cumulative risks from several establishments are not taken into account. The negligible risk levels specified in the UK as 10 per year and in the Netherlands as 10 per year are not questionable and it will be assumed that 10 value can be accepted across the EU for the time being. 2.2 Impact Criteria The example of the consequence (impact) based criteria used in France, Salvi & Gaston 2004, is presented in Table 2. These criteria apply to the list of reference or predefined scenarios such as boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (for liquefied combustible gases), unconfined vapour cloud explosion (for liquefied combustible gases), total instantaneous loss of containment (for liquefied, nonliquefied and toxic gases), instantaneous rupture of the largest pipeline leading to the highest mass flow (toxic gas installations), fire in the largest tank (for flammable liquids), etc. Table 2 Impact Thresholds\n\n==\n\nWoodruff 2005:\n\nTitle: Consequence and likelihood in risk estimation: A matter of balance in UK health and safety risk assessment practice\n\nAbstract: This paper argues that existing semi-quantitative risk estimation methodologies commonly applied within UK health and safety risk assessment practice are biased towards considerations of possible consequence rather than overall risk. This is seen to be leading to a slow shift towards risk aversion within UK health and safety decision making. A reworking of existing risk estimation methodology is proposed. Instead of seeking an explicit value for the level of risk the paper suggests that in lower risk industrial and commercial sectors it is sufficient to establish whether the risk is likely to fall within an intolerable, tolerable or acceptable risk zone. Once this evaluation has been completed it is further argued that risks judged to fall within the tolerable zone, which equates to a legal duty to reduce risk so far as reasonably practicable in UK, can be prioritised using values of exposure to the hazard. The method is seen as having significant advantages over other semi-quantitative risk estimation approaches presently used in UK.\n\n==\n\nBuchanan 1997:\n\nTitle: Assessing risk: limits to the measurement of the target behaviours\n\nAbstract: A serious problem in the assessment of the risk of violence or other dangerous or antisocial behaviour is that the target acts do not lend themselves to measurement as readily as supposed. This problem imposes limits to the validity of research in this field. The limits become particularly serious when the sole data on the behaviour are from official, national statistics on crime. Risk factors derived solely from such an association must be regarded as suspect. Criminal data alone thus pose a double jeopardy on clinical practice-calling into question on the one hand some of the so-called information based principles behind assessments and on the other offering relatively little to the direct assessment process in the individual case. Some of the reasons behind this call for caution are discussed.\n\n==\n\nKaltoft 2018:\n\nTitle: Risk Thresholds and Risk Classifications Pose Problems for Person-Centred Care\n\nAbstract: Classification of a continuous risk score into risk levels is common. However, while the absolute risk score is essential, it is arguably unethical to label anyone at 'high, moderate or low risk' of a serious event, simply because management based on a single criterion (e.g. avoiding the target condition) has been determined to be effective or cost-effective at a population level. Legally, mono-criterial risk labeling can inhibit the obtaining of a fully-informed, preference-based consent, since multiple considerations (various benefits and harms) matter to most individuals, not only the single criterion that is the basis of the provided risk category. These ethical and legal challenges can be met by preference-sensitive multi-criteria decision support tools. In this future vision paper, we demonstrate, at a conceptual proof-of-method level, how such decision support can and should be developed without reference to risk-level classifications. The statin decision is used as illustration, without any empirical claims.", "final_summary": "The question of determining the optimal risk threshold when assessing the danger of an activity is a complex and multifaceted issue, as evidenced by the diverse range of perspectives presented in the collected papers.\n\nDeKay (2002) introduces a decision-analytic model that identifies thresholds for the subjective probability that an activity is unsafe. This model suggests that lower thresholds may warrant more precautionary action. Stam (1998), on the other hand, highlights the ongoing debate over setting limit values for risk thresholds, indicating that a universally accepted standard has yet to be established.\n\nGrassi (2009) proposes a new methodology for risk evaluation that incorporates factors such as human behavior and environmental effects on risk level. This approach suggests that a more comprehensive evaluation of risk factors could lead to a more optimal risk threshold. Phillips (2012) emphasizes the importance of assessing whether an individual poses a risk of endangering self or others now or in the near future, suggesting that the optimal risk threshold may vary depending on the individual and the context.\n\nTrbojevic (2005) focuses on risk criteria used in the EU for population living in vicinity of hazardous facilities, suggesting that the optimal risk threshold may depend on societal risk criteria and individual risk criteria. Woodruff (2005) argues that existing risk estimation methodologies are biased towards considerations of possible consequence rather than overall risk, suggesting that a balance between consequence and likelihood is necessary for determining the optimal risk threshold.\n\nBuchanan (1997) highlights the limitations of measuring target behaviors in assessing risk, suggesting that the optimal risk threshold may be difficult to determine due to these measurement challenges. Finally, Kaltoft (2018) argues against the classification of a continuous risk score into risk levels, suggesting that such classifications can inhibit fully-informed, preference-based consent.\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal risk threshold when assessing the danger of an activity appears to depend on a variety of factors, including the subjective probability that an activity is unsafe, the balance between consequence and likelihood, and the consideration of human behavior and environmental effects. Further research is needed to develop a more comprehensive and universally accepted standard for determining the optimal risk threshold."}, {"query": "\u00ab Comment les personnels soignants travaillant dans les structures sanitaires peuvent-ils mettre en \u0153uvre des strat\u00e9gies pour minimiser la stigmatisation et faciliter l'acc\u00e8s et l'utilisation du kit de prophylaxie post-exposition (KIT-PEP) par les survivantes de violences sexuelles, dans l'Est de la R\u00e9publique D\u00e9mocratique du Congo ?

Armed groups from the DRC and neighbouring countries are committing atrocities and systematically using sexual violence as a weapon of war to humiliate, intimidate and dominate women, girls, their men and communities. Armed combatants take advantage with impunity, knowing they will not be held to account or pursued by police or judicial authorities. A particularly inhumane public health problem has emerged: traumatic gynaecological fistula and genital injury from brutal sexual violence and gang-rape, along with enormous psychosocial and emotional burdens. Many of the women who survive find themselves pregnant or infected with STIs/HIV with no access to treatment. This report was compiled at the Doctors on Call for Service/Heal Africa Hospital in Goma, Eastern Congo, from the cases of 4,715 women and girls who suffered sexual violence between April 2003 and June 2006, of whom 702 had genital fistula. It presents the personal experiences of seven survivors whose injuries were severe and long-term, with life-changing effects. The paper recommends a coordinated effort amongst key stakeholders to secure peace and stability, an increase in humanitarian assistance and the rebuilding of the infrastructure, human and physical resources, and medical, educational and judicial systems.

But whose voice is louder?\u2019 Health, aid and decision-making in the Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nAbstract: In the last decade, scholars and humanitarians have rightly drawn attention to the high rates of gender-based violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which are associated with the high levels of conflict in the country since 1996. However, this focus detracts from the general health problems that stem from the deterioration of the health sector, which began long before the outbreak of war. This article analyses local perceptions of the determinants of maternal health and illness in eastern DRC, and identifies ways in which women cope with barriers to health care that derive from an inadequate and/or absent health-care system. The article demonstrates that in both urban and rural locations in all four provinces of eastern DRC, women have organised to address their own vulnerabilities, which, according to them, amount to more than exposure to gender-based violence. The existence of these informal systems demonstrates the need to reassess the image of Congolese women as primarily passive victims and/or targets of violence. The article suggests that these culturally rooted indigenous solutions be evaluated as worthy recipients of development funding, which is often exclusively offered to international organisations.

Durant la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie, les \u00e9rudits et les humanitaires ont correctement attir\u00e9 l'attention sur les taux \u00e9lev\u00e9s de violence sur la seule base du genre dans l'est de la R\u00e9publique D\u00e9mocratique du Congo (RDC), qui sont en lien avec les hauts niveaux de conflit dans le pays depuis 1996. Pourtant, cette attention sur les violences sexuelles d\u00e9tourne l'attention qui devrait \u00eatre port\u00e9e aux probl\u00e8mes sanitaires g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qui sont dus \u00e0 la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration du secteur de la sant\u00e9, qui a commenc\u00e9 longtemps avant l'\u00e9mergence de la guerre.

L'existence de ces syst\u00e8mes informels d\u00e9montre le besoin de reconsid\u00e9rer l'image des femmes congolaises comme \u00e9tant en premier lieu des victimes passives et/ou des objets de violences.

To achieve this, the study, using a Grounded Theory methodology, used the files of victims of sexual violence in the courts, the minutes of meetings, discussion groups, the life stories of victims and grey literature as sources. The problems identified are multiple and varied and include: dysfunctional judicial services; lack of evidence from the parties concerned (doctors, police, prison officers, etc.); extreme poverty of the victims; delaying tactics that tend to perpetually postpone hearings in order to slow down the trial or block the action through irregular procedures; out-of-court settlements; the inadequacy and geographical remoteness of the jurisdictions competent in matters of sexual violence; the social environment of the victims; and insecurity and fear of reprisals. What can be done? The problem of sexual violence requires the involvement of the whole community. Given that the problem of sexual violence requires the involvement of the whole community, this research proposes awareness-raising campaigns, training sessions and concrete actions as solutions to the problems identified.", "final_summary": "The research question focuses on how healthcare workers in health facilities can implement strategies to minimize stigma and facilitate access and use of the post-exposure prophylaxis kit (KIT-PEP) by survivors of sexual violence in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). \n\nDuroch (2010) highlights the learning processes of the humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) around the concept of victims of sexual violence.

Today's trends of global competition and shortening of product life cycles suggest that both the challenges and the intensity of market volatility will only increase. Consequently, the study of tactics for maximizing the flexibility and responsiveness of a job shop is important. Indeed, there is a significant body of literature that has produced guidelines on when and how to deploy tactics such as alternate routings for jobs and transfers of cross-trained workers between machines. \n \n \n \nIn this paper we consider a different tactic by adjusting the length of workdays. Hours in excess of a 40-hour week are exchanged for compensatory time off at time and a half, and the total amount of accrued compensatory time is limited to no more than 160 hours in accordance with pending legislation. We propose several simple flexible workday policies that are based on an input/output control approach and investigate their performance in a simulated job shop. We find significant gains in performance over a fixed schedule of eight hours per day. Our results also provide insights into the selection of policy parameters.\n\n==\n\nYang 2003:\n\nTitle: Exploratory analysis of flexible workday policies in a job shop\n\nAbstract: The degree to which simple policies for varying the length of each workday can affect job shop performance was investigated. The performance of a job shop operating on a fixed 8-hour day schedule was compared with a job shop that had some flexibility to vary an employee's workday by compensating hours in excess of an 8-hour day with an equivalent amount of time off. Thus, each flexible workday policy maintains an average workday of 8 hours/day for each employee. We simulated a hypothetical job shop to assess the effects of various environmental factors and workday policies on measures of interest to management and labour. We found significant improvement in job flow time with overtime (and time off) as little as an average of 24 min for every 8 hours of work.\n\n==\n\nMenezes 2011:\n\nTitle: Flexible Working and Performance: A Systematic Review of the Evidence for a Business Case\n\nAbstract: Interest in the outcomes of flexible working arrangements (FWAs) dates from the mid-1970s, when researchers attempted to assess the impact of flexitime on worker performance. This paper reviews the literature on the link between FWAs and performance-related outcomes. Taken together, the evidence fails to demonstrate a business case for the use of FWAs.

It has become a formal procedure in measuring the progress of employee\u2019s work scales. It is an important procedure in measuring the growth of work progress and it promotes the promotion of the employees. Performance evaluation helps in grading the employees annually and aids in salary raises. Further, it also enhances the quality of work progress, provides useful feedback regarding the work performed. This paper tries to investigate the importance of performance evaluation and its importance in the organisatinal sector.

Due to the ever-changing working environment and competitive markets, organizations opted to choose more flexible work options so they can respond to the volatile environment. This study explores the moderation effect of supervisor support (SS) between flexible working arrangements (FWAs) and employee performance (EP). The population for this study primarily focused on the organizations that adopt the flexible working arrangement such as flexible working time, working from home, and compressed work-week practices in Malaysia. The companies selected are based on the listing of global organizations practices FWAs mentioned in TalentCorp Malaysia Flexible Working Arrangement collaboration with Malaysian Federation Employer report, 2015. The questionnaires were distributed through the Human Resource Department of each organization. The result demonstrated that there is a relationship between FWAs and EP but there was no moderation effect of SS between FWAs and EP relationship. This study supports the idea that the employees seem to benefit from the adoption of FWAs at the workplace. It allows both gender and single or married employees to manage their time better particularly allowing the employees to attend to personal needs. Since FWAs itself is the support given by employers to employees, therefore, the employees were unable to associate supervisor support role as a contributor to help them manage their work and home responsibilities. This study showed that employee motivation to perform are affected by the policies adopted by organizations. Adopting efficient work practices such as FWAs could stimulate employee engagement to improve their work performance. Therefore, organizations that are currently searching for a strategy that can improve productivity and employee performance should consider FWAs as an option. However, the implementation ofFWAs needs to be customized according to the employee's needs. Offering FWAs in the organization will enhance organizational and individual outcomes.\n\n==\n\nMenezes 2017:\n\nTitle: Flexible Working, Individual Performance, and Employee Attitudes: Comparing Formal and Informal Arrangements\n\nAbstract: In the context of a wider trend to individualize HRM, this paper examines the relationship between flexible working arrangements and individual performance. Drawing on a range of theories, it examines potential indirect effects on employee performance via job satisfaction and organizational commitment and analyses whether these relationships vary according to whether the arrangement was set up through a formal process, or negotiated informally between the employee and their line manager. Extant research has tended to focus on formal arrangements, however, informal arrangements are widespread and may better accommodate work-life preferences, thereby potentially fostering more positive attitudes from employees. Survey data from 2617 employees in four large organizations with well-established flexible working policies are analysed. Results from structural equation models show average positive indirect effects from informal, but also negative direct effects, from formal flexible working. When two forms of flexible working amenable to being set up by both formal and informal means are examined separately: formal arrangements for flexibility over working hours are found to be negatively associated with performance, but also a source of greater job satisfaction; informal remote working arrangements have positive indirect effects via organizational commitment and job satisfaction on worker performance.\n\n==\n\nStavrou 2005:\n\nTitle: Flexible work bundles and organizational competitiveness: a cross\u2010national study of the European work context\n\nAbstract: The present study explores the categorization of flexible work arrangements (FWAs) into bundles and their connection to organizational competitiveness in the European Union. The measures of competitiveness were performance, turnover, and absenteeism. Four moderators were used in the study, organization sector, industry sector, organization size, and organizational women-supportiveness. The analyses revealed four FWA Bundles, namely Non-Standard Work Patterns, Work Away from the Office, Non-Standard Work Hours and Work Outsourced. Non-Standard Work Patterns were found to be related to decreased turnover (in the private sector), while Work Away from the Office was related to improved performance and reduced absenteeism. Non-Standard Work Hours and Work Outsourced (within the public sector) were positively related to turnover, suggesting that these types are possibly not being used as true flexibility arrangements. Finally, post-hoc analysis revealed that Non-Standard Work Hours was related to increased performance only among Swedish organizations. Implications for management and future research are discussed.

The study examined the relationship between flexible work arrangement and employees performance with emphasis on public schools in Lagos State. Daily commuting by workers in public schools in Lagos State could expose them to high risk of health hazards due to fixed term employment. Furthermore, increase in commuting raises the level of road congestions, high cost of transport, maintenance of vehicles, traffic and road facilities with exhaustion and stress as negative impacts on commuters. Questionnaire were designed to assess the views of respondents and potency of flexible work arrangement in the state. The study adopted a survey research and CMS Grammar School as a case study. Based on random sampling method, a total of 160 employees were selected as sample size drawn from a population size of 400 workers. Analysis was conducted with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and Pearson correlation coefficient as test statistics. The hypothesis that there is no significant relationship between flexible work arrangement and employees\u2019 performance was formulated to determine the statistical significance of the study. The study found out that there was a significant relationship between flexible work arrangement and employees\u2019 performance thus the null hypothesis was rejected.

While constructivists acknowledge there is a biological dimension to emotion, they deny that emotions are (or involve) affect programs. So they also deny emotions are natural kinds. However, the essential role that constructivism gives to felt experience and folk concepts leads to an account that is extensionally inadequate and functionally inaccurate. Moreover, biologically oriented proposals that reject these commitments are not similarly encumbered. Recognizing this has two implications: biological mechanisms are more central to emotion than constructivism allows, and the conclusion that emotions are not natural kinds is premature.\n\n==\n\nLindquist 2008:\n\nTitle: Constructing Emotion\n\nAbstract: This study examined the hypothesis that emotion is a psychological event constructed from the more basic elements of core affect and conceptual knowledge. Participants were primed with conceptual knowledge of fear, conceptual knowledge of anger, or a neutral prime and then proceeded through an affect-induction procedure designed to induce unpleasant, high-arousal affect or a neutral affective state. As predicted, only those individuals for whom conceptual knowledge of fear had been primed experienced unpleasant core affect as evidence that the world was threatening. This study provides the first experimental support for the hypothesis that people experience world-focused emotion when they conceptualize their core affective state using accessible knowledge about emotion.\n\n==\n\nMesquita 2016:\n\nTitle: The cultural construction of emotions.\n\nAbstract: A large body of anthropological and psychological research on emotions has yielded significant evidence that emotional experience is culturally constructed: people more commonly experience those emotions that help them to be a good and typical person in their culture. Moreover, experiencing these culturally normative emotions is associated with greater well-being. In this review, we summarize recent research showing how emotions are actively constructed to meet the demands of the respective cultural environment; we discuss collective as well as individual processes of construction. By focusing on cultural construction of emotion, we shift the focus toward how people from different cultures 'do' emotions and away from which emotions they 'have'.\n\n==\n\nAverill 1980:\n\nTitle: A CONSTRUCTIVIST VIEW OF EMOTION\n\nAbstract: ABSTRACT Traditionally, the emotions have been viewed from a biological perspective; that is, the emotions have been seen as genetically determined and relatively invariable responses. The present chapter, by contrast, views the emotions as social constructions. More precisely, the emotions are here defined as socially constituted syndromes or transitory social roles. A role-conception does not deny the contribution of biological systems to emotional syndromes; it does, however, imply that the functional significance of emotional responses is to be found largely within the sociocultural system. With regard to subjective experience, a person interprets his own behavior as emotional in much the same way that an actor interprets a role\u201cwith feeling.\u201d This involves not only the monitoring of behavior (including feedback from physiological arousal, facial expressions, etc.), but also an understanding of how the emotional role fits into a larger\u201cdrama\u201d written by society. Some of the biological, personal, and situational factors that influence emotional behavior are also discussed.\n\n==\n\nKippax 1988:\n\nTitle: Constructing emotions: Weaving meaning from memories\n\nAbstract: This paper is in three sections\u2014theory, method and data. We consider that emotions are socially constructed, and begin with an interpretation of social constructionism as it applies to emotion. The conclusion drawn from the analysis of theories from a variety of disciplines is that it is important to incorporate and extend the notion of appraisal into a study of emotion. This notion is prominent in the cognitive approach and the social constructionist approach allows the cognitive and social views of emotion to be integrated. \n \n \n \nThis approach enabled us to examine the process whereby individuals engage with each other, and hence with the social structures, in their construction of emotions. We employed a method \u2018memory-work\u2019 which uses written memories as source material. This is discussed at some length since it is integrated within a theory of socialization which is closely related to social constructionism. \n \n \n \nFinally, we present an analysis of some data which illustrate and demonstrate the processes involved in constructing emotion. Our work confirms and extends the social constructionist view. Paradoxically, in highlighting the notion of agency, we stress the essentially social nature of the individual and overcome some of the problems which arise in methods which examine only the individual or the society.\n\n==\n\nFranco 2020:\n\nTitle: Constructed emotions and superinformation: a constructor-theoretic approach\n\nAbstract: In this paper we apply the constructor-theoretic approach to the theory of constructed emotions, showing that core affect valence and knowledge can be considered as two different observables, leading to information or superinformation conditions: this depends on subject's strategy, coherently with the affect infusion model. In the second part of the article we show that additional hypotheses on the structure of information allows to study emotions in terms of the contructor-theoretic version of phase task. Quantum algorithms are presented as an example of the connection between emotions and memory tasks.\n\n==\n\nSibia 2013:\n\nTitle: Social Construction of Emotions\n\nAbstract: The traditional view that emotions are primarily biological, involuntary bodily changes or evolved adaptations has been challenged by social constructivists such as psychologists, anthropologist and philosopher Claire. The proponents of the social constructivist approach argue that emotions have meaning and are experienced and expressed in a particular socio-cultural context. According to \u201cemotions are not only remnants of our phylogenetic past, nor can they be explained in strictly physiological terms.

The view, however, has several counterintuitive implications: for instance, a person can have multiple distinct emotions at once. Further, the TCE concludes that emotions are constitutively social phenomena. In this article, I explicate the TCE*, which, while substantially similar to the TCE, makes several distinct claims aimed at avoiding the counterintuitive implications plaguing the TCE. Further, because of the changes that comprise the TCE*, emotions are not constitutively social phenomena.", "final_summary": "The question of whether emotions are constructed has been a topic of extensive debate among researchers.

Some researchers emphasize the role of conceptual knowledge and cultural context in the construction of emotions, while others highlight the importance of social interactions and structures.

Cloud computing is one of the representative technologies that can perform massive-scale and complex data computing by taking advantages of virtualized resources, parallel processing and data service integration with scalable data storage. However, as we are also experiencing the revolution of Internet-of-things (IoT), the limitations of cloud computing on supporting lightweight end devices significantly impede the flourish of cloud computing at the intersection of big data and IoT era. It also promotes the urgency of proposing new computing paradigms. We provide an overview on the topic of big data, and a comprehensive survey on how cloud computing as well as its related technologies can address the challenges arisen by big data. Then, we analyze the disadvantages of cloud computing when big data encounters IoT, and introduce two promising computing paradigms, including fog computing and transparent computing, to support the big data services of IoT.

The findings identified and visualized the ten largest network clusters of participants who interacted with each other and examined the dater characteristics most responsible for cluster membership. Rated attractiveness and age were the strongest cluster correlates, whereas education and race were relatively uncommon determinants. In sum, daters\u2019 interdependent actions created aggregate communities unseen by the users themselves, but no less influential for dating opportunities, that were based more on attractiveness and age than on race and education.\n\n==\n\nMasden 2015:\n\nTitle: Understanding the Role of Community in Online Dating\n\nAbstract: Online dating sites have become a common means of finding a romantic partner. And yet, these sites differ greatly from many other socially oriented websites: perhaps most notably, the pairwise style of interaction afforded by these sites prevents a robust online community from forming. Users, however, have taken matters into their own hands by creating thriving external forums for discussion of specific dating sites. We report on a multiple methods study of two online dating services, via observation and interviews with users of the forums associated with these sites. Our findings suggest that these forums play an essential role in creating an \"outsourced community\" for the dating sites, and also reveal practices around how some users \"game the system\" in online dating, the prevalence of harassment in online dating, and users' frustrations with current dating sites. We conclude with a number of recommendations for system design.\n\n==\n\nBruch 2018:\n\nTitle: Aspirational pursuit of mates in online dating markets\n\nAbstract: We present an empirical analysis of heterosexual dating markets in four U.S. cities using data from a popular online dating service. Romantic courtship is often described as taking place in a dating market where men and women compete for mates, but the detailed structure and dynamics of dating markets have historically been difficult to quantify for lack of suitable data. In recent years, however, the advent and vigorous growth of the online dating industry has provided a rich new source of information on mate pursuit. We present an empirical analysis of heterosexual dating markets in four large U.S. cities using data from a popular, free online dating service. We show that competition for mates creates a pronounced hierarchy of desirability that correlates strongly with user demographics and is remarkably consistent across cities. We find that both men and women pursue partners who are on average about 25% more desirable than themselves by our measures and that they use different messaging strategies with partners of different desirability. We also find that the probability of receiving a response to an advance drops markedly with increasing difference in desirability between the pursuer and the pursued. Strategic behaviors can improve one\u2019s chances of attracting a more desirable mate, although the effects are modest.\n\n==\n\nBurtch 2016:\n\nTitle: ASSESSING AND QUANTIFYING NETWORK EFFECTS IN AN ONLINE DATING MARKET\n\nAbstract: Motivat ion. Two-sided markets (or multi-sided markets more generally) are roughly defined as platforms that enable transaction and interaction amongst end-users of different types (Parker and Val Alstyne 2005; Rochet and Tirole 2006). Examples of these markets are now quite prevalent \u2013 e.g., Hulu matches video content providers with end-consumers and advertisers, eBay connects buyers and sellers, and AirBNB links renters and hosts. Perhaps the oldest example, however, is the market for dating, which we consider here.\n\n==\n\nHeino 2010:\n\nTitle: Relationshopping: Investigating the market metaphor in online dating\n\nAbstract: In this manuscript we explore the ways in which the marketplace metaphor resonates with online dating participants and how this conceptual framework influences how they assess themselves, assess others, and make decisions about whom to pursue. Taking a metaphor approach enables us to highlight the ways in which participants\u2019 language shapes their self-concept and interactions with potential partners. Qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with 34 participants from a large online dating site revealed that the marketplace metaphor was salient for participants, who employed several strategies that reflected the assumptions underlying the marketplace perspective (including resisting the metaphor). We explore the implications of this metaphor for romantic relationship development, such as the objectification of potential partners.\n\n==\n\nBishop 2010:\n\nTitle: Understanding and Facilitating the Development of Social Networks in Online Dating Communities: A Case Study and Model\n\nAbstract: Online dating is a big business, allowing people from the comfort of their own home to view and read about potential mates all around the world. Different dating sites offer different services. However, it is not yet commonplace for Web sites dedicated to dating to use the social networking tools used by popular online communities, such as those that use the personal homepage and message board genres. The ecological cognition framework (ECF) provides a theoretical model regarding online dating communities\u2019 behavior and relationship development. A model based on the ECF is proposed and provides a basis for developing online dating services that effectively support relationship development. Two investigations are presented in this chapter, one that uses a case study approach to identify and describe online dating services from the perspective of a specific case and another that assess the effectiveness of existing online dating services based on the guidelines developed from the case study. The case study provides a useful insight into the nature of social networking from the perspective of a specific case, which led to guidelines for developing e-dating systems that when evaluated showed that the most popular social networking services also score well against the criteria proposed in those guidelines.\n\n==\n\nGal-Or 2020:\n\nTitle: Market segmentation on dating platforms\n\nAbstract: Abstract Individuals from two populations seek matchmaking services from competing dating websites. Each population is heterogeneous along an objective quality rank and matched couples experience disutility if there are incompatibilities in their quality ranks. Individuals in the populations care also about other traits that they wish their partner to possess. They are more likely to find a partner possessing such traits, the bigger the population served by the website. We investigate whether price competition can lead to segmentation of the two populations. We find that segmentation arises, only if compatibility in quality is relatively important to individuals in comparison to the importance of matching with high quality partners and in comparison to cross network externalities. At the market equilibrium, too many men and women patronize the website that matches high quality individuals. Allowing websites to price discriminate between men and women reduces social welfare.", "final_summary": "The online dating market, a complex web of interactions and preferences, is structured by a variety of factors. Geographic proximity is a significant driver of romantic interaction at a national level, but at a local level, age and ethnicity partition the dating market into submarkets (Bruch, 2019). These submarkets are further characterized by varying sex ratios and a tendency for minorities, particularly women, to be younger than the average in older submarkets (Bruch, 2019).\n\nThe online dating market also exhibits a pronounced hierarchy of desirability, with both men and women pursuing partners who are on average about 25% more desirable than themselves (Bruch, 2018). This hierarchy correlates strongly with user demographics and is remarkably consistent across cities (Bruch, 2018).\n\nInvisible clusters, or subgroups, also exist within the online dating community, formed by aggregated partner preferences (Felmlee, 2017). These clusters are primarily based on attractiveness and age, with education and race being less common determinants (Felmlee, 2017).\n\nThe marketplace metaphor is a resonant concept in online dating, influencing how participants assess themselves and others, and make decisions about whom to pursue (Heino, 2010). This metaphor can lead to the objectification of potential partners (Heino, 2010).\n\nOnline dating communities also play a crucial role in the dating process. Users have created external forums for discussion of specific dating sites, forming an \"outsourced community\" (Masden, 2015). These forums reveal practices around how some users \"game the system\" in online dating, the prevalence of harassment in online dating, and users' frustrations with current dating sites (Masden, 2015).\n\nIn conclusion, the structure of online dating markets is multifaceted, influenced by geographic proximity, age, ethnicity, desirability, and the marketplace metaphor. Invisible clusters and outsourced communities also play a significant role in shaping the online dating landscape. Understanding these factors can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of online dating and inform the design of more effective dating platforms."}, {"query": "recovery time from injection for meralgia parenthetica and Iliotibial band syndrome", "paper_list_string": "Ataizi 2018:\n\nTitle: Surgical options for meralgia paresthetica: long-term outcomes in 13 cases\n\nAbstract: Abstract Background: Meralgia paresthetica is an entrapment neuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve that may cause paresthesias, pain, and sensory loss of the anterior and lateral thigh. Treatment is primarily medical. Surgery is an option for patients who do not respond to medical treatments. Methods: Patients whose symptoms did not improve after medical and conservative treatment for at least 3 months were included in this study. These patients underwent neurolysis and decompression surgery and had a mean postoperative follow-up of 38 months. Their pain levels were assessed by the VAS scoring system. Results: In 8 (61.5%) patients, the symptoms completely resolved within the first 3 months. In 5 (38.5%) patients, the complaints persisted partially and the recovery was observed after 12 months. In patients having a metabolic etiology, the duration of recovery was up to 12 months. Conclusion: The long term results of surgery are good though only partial improvemnts in reported pain were seen in the early postoperative period, especially in patients with a metabolic etiology.\n\n==\n\nEdelson 1994:\n\nTitle: Meralgia paresthetica in children.\n\nAbstract: We reviewed the findings in twenty children and adolescents who had meralgia paresthetica, a common entity in adults that has only rarely been reported in children. Ten patients had bilateral involvement; thus, the study included thirty lesions. Twenty-four lesions were eventually treated with open decompression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve; the results of twenty-one of these operations were followed for at least two years. The presenting symptom was severe pain resulting in marked restriction of activities. The pain could be reproduced with palpation of the nerve, and a trial injection of Xylocaine (lidocaine) always produced transient relief of symptoms. The average age at the onset of the symptoms was ten years (range, one to seventeen years); the diagnosis was missed initially in ten patients, which resulted in multiple, unnecessary diagnostic tests being done. The average duration of the symptoms before the patient was first seen was twenty-four months (range, two to eighty-four months), and the average duration of follow-up after the twenty-one operations was thirty-eight months (range, twenty-five to sixty months). Fourteen of the twenty-one operations led to an excellent result, with complete relief of pain and no restriction of activities; five led to a good result, with occasional pain but no limitation of sports or other activities; and two led to a fair result, with pain that interfered with sports activities but not with walking. We believe that meralgia paresthetica is much more common in children than has been previously recognized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\n==\n\nSiu 2005:\n\nTitle: Neurolysis for meralgia paresthetica: an operative series of 45 cases.\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nFailure of symptom relief after neurolysis for meralgia paresthetica (MP) is reported frequently, yet systematic outcome analysis is limited in the modern literature. The present operative series of 45 cases aims to address this issue.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom 1996 to 2000, all patients who had neurolysis for MP by our senior author were enrolled in the study. Nerve entrapment was confirmed preoperatively by electrophysiological studies or a positive response to local anesthetic and steroid injection. Attention to the anatomical variability of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was made during nerve exploration. Decompression of the nerve was performed at the level of the iliac fascia, the inguinal ligament, and the fascia of the thigh distally. The outcome of surgery was assessed 6 weeks after the procedure followed by 3 monthly intervals if symptoms persisted. Telephone interviews were conducted to assess long-term results.\n\n\nRESULTS\nForty-five decompressive procedures were performed in 42 patients over the 5-year period. The average duration of symptoms was 31 (2.5-180) months. All patients were followed for an average of 4.1 years. Complete and partial symptom improvements were noted in 33 (73%) and 9 (20%) cases, respectively. No recurrence was reported. Analysis of clinical variables demonstrated that the duration of symptoms preoperatively did not affect the rate of complete symptom relief, but obese patients (body mass index > 30) was 6 times more likely to have (odds ratio 6.16, P = 0.04) incomplete relief after surgery at long-term follow-up.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHigh success rate was recorded in our series of 45 cases. Prolonged duration of symptoms did not preclude favorable outcome but obesity had a negative association with good outcome.\n\n==\n\nWeier 2010:\n\nTitle: Meralgia paresthetica of the contralateral leg after total hip arthroplasty.\n\nAbstract: In the United States, total hip arthroplasty (THA) is typically performed with the patient in the lateral decubitus position. Positioning of the morbidly obese patient can be technically challenging and may require special positioning equipment. Although the increased incidence of complications after THA in obese patients has been well documented, neurologic complications in the contralateral limb are rare. This article describes a case of a patient with impairment of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve in the contralateral leg after THA.A 55-year-old woman with a body mass index of 34.24 kg/m(2) underwent THA in the right lateral decubitus position. Because of her body habitus, a bean-bag positioner was used. Total hip arthroplasty was performed using a direct lateral approach. Intraoperative surgical time was 2.5 hours, and total anesthesia time was 3.5 hours. A few days postoperatively, the patient began to experience \"burning and shooting\" pain in the contralateral hip, but she did not report this pain until 6 weeks postoperatively. She was treated initially with a single lidocaine injection. When this was ineffective, she was treated with topiramate (100 mg daily) and vitamin B6 (100 mg orally twice daily). The symptoms lessened markedly at 5 months and resolved completely at 9 months postoperatively.Meralgia paresthetica is an uncommon, but known, complication of THA. To our knowledge, it has been reported only in the operative limb. This report reinforces the need for careful positioning to avoid pressure over the anterior superior iliac spine intraoperatively.\n\n==\n\nFranklin 2016:\n\nTitle: Interventional and multimodal pain rehabilitation in a child with meralgia paresthetica.\n\nAbstract: Meralgia paresthetica is a chronic pain syndrome that is extremely rare in the pediatric population. It is manifested by hypesthesia or pain in the distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) and is typically caused by entrapment as the nerve passes deep to the inguinal ligament. This sensory mononeuropathy is rare in children and diagnosis is typically delayed, often leading to prolonged functional impairment and unnecessary medical testing. A 9-year-old girl presented to the pain clinic with a 6-week history of right anterolateral thigh pain first noticed after a nontraumatic cheerleading practice. Comprehensive laboratory and radiographic evaluation by multiple prior specialists revealed no clear nociceptive source of pain. History and examination were consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic, compressive meralgia paresthetica. Conservative management including physical therapy was followed for 2 weeks with only mild improvement noted. To facilitate physical therapy, an ultrasound-guided LFCN block was performed which confirmed the diagnosis by providing complete analgesia. The patient reported overall 25% improvement from multimodal therapy at another 2 weeks. A second LFCN block was performed with complete resolution of symptoms and restoration of function. The patient remains pain-free and has returned to walking, running, and competitive sports. The primary goal of pediatric chronic pain management, regardless of pain etiology, is early restoration of function to avoid prolonged absence from school, sports, or other productive activities and limit the psychological burden of chronic disease.\n\n==\n\nMd 2011:\n\nTitle: Treatment of Meralgia Paresthetica with Ultrasound-Guided Pulsed Radiofrequency Ablation of the Lateral Femoral Cutaneous Nerve\n\nAbstract: Abstract:\u2002 A 23-year-old female with an 18-month history of left anterolateral thigh paresthesias and burning pain consistent with meralgia paresthetica was referred to our clinic after failing trials of physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, gabapentin, and amitriptyline.

Multiple treatment options targeting the LFCN can be pursued to treat the pain should conservative measures fail, with the most common options being injection, neurolysis, and neurectomy. However, their efficacy in causing pain relief and their clinical outcomes have yet to be directly compared. The aim of this study was to interrogate the contemporary literature and quantitatively define how these options compare.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe electronic databases Ovid Embase, PubMed, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library were interrogated from inception to May 2020 following the PRISMA guidelines. Candidate articles were screened against prespecified criteria. Outcome data were abstracted and pooled by random-effects meta-analysis of proportions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 25 articles that satisfied all criteria, reporting outcomes for a total of 670 meralgia paresthetica patients, with 78 (12%) treated by injection, 496 (74%) by neurolysis, and 96 (14%) by neurectomy. The incidence of complete pain relief was 85% (95% CI 71%-96%) after neurectomy, 63% (95% CI 56%-71%) after neurolysis, and 22% (95% CI 13%-33%) after injection, which were all statistically different (p < 0.01). The incidence of revision procedures was 12% (95% CI 4%-22%) after neurolysis and 0% (95% CI 0%-2%) after neurectomy, which were significantly lower than 81% (95% CI 64%-94%) after injection (p < 0.01). The incidences of treatment complications were statistically comparable across all three treatments, ranging from 0% to 5% (p = 0.34).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere are multiple treatment options to target pain in meralgia paresthetica. The incidence of complete pain relief appears to be the greatest among the 3 interventions after neurectomy, accompanied by the lowest incidence of revision procedures. These findings should help inform patient preference and expectations. Greater exploration of the anatomical rationale for incomplete pain relief after surgical intervention will assist in optimizing further surgical treatment for meralgia paresthetica.", "final_summary": "The research question at hand explores the recovery time from injection for meralgia paresthetica and Iliotibial band syndrome.

MgCM is a mixed salt consisting of magnesium cations and citrate and malate anions, and with a magnesium content of 12\u201315%. MgCM is proposed to be used in food supplements that are intended to provide up to 300\u2013540 mg/day magnesium. The data provided demonstrate that the production process results in batches of MgCM that comply with the product specifications and that the product is stable throughout its proposed shelf life. The human studies provided demonstrate that magnesium from MgCM is bioavailable. However, the extent of its bioavailability per se or compared to other magnesium sources cannot be established due to the lack of an appropriate magnesium source as a comparator in the studies provided or relevant kinetic data for magnesium. One publication provided in the dossier reported that supplementation with MgCM decreases calcium absorption, but this finding was not supported by publications on different magnesium salts and therefore the Panel could not draw conclusions from this finding. The Panel concludes that MgCM is a source from which magnesium is bioavailable, but the extent of its bioavailability cannot be established. The Panel notes that at the proposed maximum use levels of MgCM, the existing tolerable upper intake level for magnesium in nutritional supplements, water, or added to food and beverages (250 mg/day) is exceeded.\n\n==\n\nYounes 2018:\n\nTitle: Evaluation of di\u2010magnesium malate, used as a novel food ingredient and as a source of magnesium in foods for the general population, food supplements, total diet replacement for weight control and food for special medical purposes\n\nAbstract: Abstract The present scientific opinion deals with the evaluation of the safety of di\u2010magnesium malate (DMM) proposed as a novel food ingredient and as a source of magnesium for use in foods for the general population, food supplements, total diet replacement for weight control and food for special medical purposes (FSMP), and with the bioavailability of magnesium from this source. Additional information was sought from the applicant during the assessment process. However, despite several requests, the applicant did not provide the additional data. Consequently, the Panel performed this assessment on the basis of the available data and concluded that there was insufficient scientific evidence of a difference between the proposed novel food ingredient named as DMM and magnesium malate already authorised as a source of magnesium included in Annex II to Directive 2002/46/EC. Accordingly, the Panel was unable to assess the safety of DMM as a novel food ingredient. The Panel concluded that based on the data provided it was not possible to assess the dissociation of DMM into magnesium and malic acid. The Panel further concluded that if DMM dissociates, magnesium would be available following ingestion of DMM and the availability would appear similar to values reported for other sources of magnesium already permitted. Finally, the Panel noted that the proposed use levels could result in exposures to magnesium greater than its upper level (UL) (250 mg/day) for food supplements and for food for special medical purposes.\n\n==\n\nBlaquiere 1987:\n\nTitle: Speciation studies in relation to magnesium bioavailability. Formation of Mg(II) complexes with glutamate, aspartate, glycinate, lactate, pyroglutamate, pyridoxine and citrate, and appraisal of their potential significance towards magnesium gastrointestinal absorption\n\nAbstract: Abstract Associations of Mg2+ ions with organic ligands are frequently advertised as likely to enhance the bioavailability of magnesium from orally administered commercial preparations. However, no systematic study of the relevant equilibria has been produced so far to substantiate these assertions, and no superiority has yet been demonstrated for any magnesium salt on clinical grounds. After a review concerning different aspects of magnesium gastrointestinal absorption, in particular with respect to calcium interactions, this paper deals with the determination of formation constants for magnesium complexes with glutamate, aspartate, glycinate, lactate, pyroglutamate, pyridoxine and citrate, under physiological conditions of ionic strength (0.15 mol dm\u22123) and temperature (37 \u00b0C). Corresponding results are then used to assess the potential capacity of each of these ligands to mobilise Mg2+ ions into membrane diffusible complexes. At usual therapeutic concentrations, pyroglutamate and pyridoxine do not coordinate magnesium in appreciable amounts, and glycinate and lactate do not form any neutral complex. In contrast, glutamate, aspartate and citrate do form neutral magnesium species; the extent of their expected effects with respect to magnesium uptake by enterocyte membranes is discussed on the basis of relevant computer simulations. Potential calcium interactions are also examined, which required the determination of formation constants for calcium complexes with these three ligands.\n\n==\n\nMaguire 2004:\n\nTitle: Magnesium chemistry and biochemistry\n\nAbstract: Magnesium apparently derives its name from Magnesia, a district in the Volos area of Thessaly in northeastern Greece. It was used to refer to any of several minerals ranging from magnesite (magnesium carbonate or \u2018magnesia alba\u2019) to magnetite (manganese dioxide or \u2018magnesia nigra\u2019) and also magnesia stone (talc or soapstone), a magnesium silicate. However, there are also two ancient towns in Asia Minor named Magnesia from the Greek word magnes used to refer to the magnetic iron ore discovered in this area. Magnesia could have been derived from magnes but used for another mineral in a different place, just as magnesia in Greece referred to several minerals. Magnesium metal was first prepared by Sir Humphrey Davy around 1810 by making the amalgam of magnesium with mercury and then distilling off the mercury electrolytically (Treneer 1963). Davy named the new metal magnium and the word magnesium was initially used for manganese, derived from the mineral \u2018magnesia nigra\u2019. The pure metal is highly reactive and all magnesium in the biosphere is either the free cation Mg2+ in aqueous solutions or some salt or mineral form. There are several common mineral forms of magnesium in the environment. Dolomite [MgCa(CO3)2] derives its name from the Dolomite range in the Italian Alps. The story of the recognition of dolomite and various controversies that have ranged and still range around this mineral makes interesting reading for the historian of science (Hacking 1999; McKenzie 1991). Epsomite (MgSO4 \u00b7 7H2O) derives its name from the Epsom district in England, originally south of London but now incorporated into greater London. Epsom water originally came from a spring that arose on the common of Epsom village. Epsomite proved to be a major constituent of the waters. Application proved efficacious in healing of external ulcers, and the water became a destination for the sick. Until the first decade of the 18th century, Epsom was a well-known spa with many visitors partaking of the waters internally, where it acts as a purgative (Sakula 1984). Other minerals containing large amounts of magnesium are olivine (Mg2SiO4), magnesium calcite (MgSO4) and chrysolite [asbestos, Mg3Si2O5(OH)4], as well as garnet and spinel, which also contain aluminum with the magnesium.\n\n==\n\nSerefko 2013:\n\nTitle: Magnesium in depression.\n\nAbstract: Magnesium is one of the most essential mineral in the human body, connected with brain biochemistry and the fluidity of neuronal membrane. A variety of neuromuscular and psychiatric symptoms, including different types of depression, was observed in magnesium deficiency. Plasma/serum magnesium levels do not seem to be the appropriate indicators of depressive disorders, since ambiguous outcomes, depending on the study, were obtained. The emergence of a new approach to magnesium compounds in medical practice has been seen. Apart from being administered as components of dietary supplements, they are also perceived as the effective agents in treatment of migraine, alcoholism, asthma, heart diseases, arrhythmias, renal calcium stones, premenstrual tension syndrome etc. Magnesium preparations have an essential place in homeopathy as a remedy for a range of mental health problems. Mechanisms of antidepressant action of magnesium are not fully understood yet. Most probably, magnesium influences several systems associated with development of depression. The first information on the beneficial effect of magnesium sulfate given hypodermically to patients with agitated depression was published almost 100 years ago. Numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies confirmed the initial observations as well as demonstrated the beneficial safety profile of magnesium supplementation. Thus, magnesium preparations seem to be a valuable addition to the pharmacological armamentarium for management of depression.\n\n==\n\nSeitz 2014:\n\nTitle: Magnesium degradation products: effects on tissue and human metabolism.\n\nAbstract: Owing to their mechanical properties, metallic materials present a promising solution in the field of resorbable implants. The magnesium metabolism in humans differs depending on its introduction. The natural, oral administration of magnesium via, for example, food, essentially leads to an intracellular enrichment of Mg(2+) . In contrast, introducing magnesium-rich substances or implants into the tissue results in a different decomposition behavior. Here, exposing magnesium to artificial body electrolytes resulted in the formation of the following products: magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, and magnesium chloride, as well as calcium and magnesium apatites. Moreover, it can be assumed that Mg(2+) , OH(-) ions, and gaseous hydrogen are also present and result from the reaction for magnesium in an aqueous environment. With the aid of physiological metabolic processes, the organism succeeds in either excreting the above mentioned products or integrating them into the natural metabolic process.

It occurs in the insoluble form in large masses as magnesite, MgC03, and as dolomite, MgC03.CaC03. It is also present in less plentiful minerals such as asbestos (a calcium magnesium silicate), and in meerschaum, serpentine and talc, which are also silicates. In the soluble form it is present as carnallite, kainite, schijnite and kieserite. Sea water and some spring waters contain magnesium in solution. Magnesium is usually classified with the alkaline earth metals (Group II A of the Mendeleef classification), although in many ways it has closer resemblance to zinc and cadmium (Group II B). It is a light, white metal of atomic number 12 and atomic weight 24.32. It is extremely reactive and will burn in air, carbon dioxide or the halogens. Like the other metals of the alkaline earths, magnesium readily forms divalent ions, losing its two valency electrons, leaving the ion with the electronic shell of the inert gas (neon, in the case of magnesium) two units lower in atomic number. Ions of higher valency are therefore not known. The general chemical reactions of magnesium are too well known to need description.\n\n==\n\nArakawa 2004:\n\nTitle: [Magnesium (Mg)].\n\nAbstract: Magnesium, atomic number twelve, is an element essential for normal function of the nervous and cardiovascular systems. Pure magnesium is a silvery-white metal, which burns with a dazzling brilliance. It is the second most abundant mineral in cells after potassium. The two ounces or so found in the typical human body is present not as metal but as magnesium ions (positively-charged magnesium atoms found either in solution or complexed with other tissues, such as bone). Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation and the fourth most abundant cation in the body. It is an essential transmembrane and intracellular modulator of cellular electrical activity. Its deficiency in the body is nothing short of disastrous for cell life.", "final_summary": "Magnesium malate, a compound of magnesium and malic acid, has been the subject of numerous studies due to its potential health benefits and bioavailability.\n\nTurck (2018) examined the bioavailability of magnesium from magnesium citrate malate (MgCM), concluding that magnesium from MgCM is bioavailable. However, the extent of its bioavailability could not be definitively established due to the lack of comparative studies with other magnesium sources.

The applied classification of growing and fast-growing firms is based on microeconomic theory. Results exhibit that despite larger year-to-year fluctuations, firms with growth towards their long-term equilibrium contributed most to macroeconomic aggregates, i.e. employment, capital and sales, especially in times of economic prosperity. Firms with growth that shifts them closer to their short-term equilibrium proved to be more important primarily for assuring employment stability. Furthermore, we show that using single growth measures prevents us from identifying all growing firms and capturing the true contribution of particular growth groups of firms to studied macroeconomic aggregates. The paper provides both theoretical and empirical information for managers for designing different types of firm growth and enables policy makers to adopt adequate industrial policy measures.\n\n==\n\nBirley 1990:\n\nTitle: Growth and performance contrasts between \u2018types\u2019 of small firms\n\nAbstract: This paper studies the interrelationships in the strategic profile of a sample of small firms, and, by using cross\u2010sectional analysis, attempts to identify any evidence to support the \u2018stages of growth\u2019 theories. Three surrogates for comparative growth were used in the analysis: number of employees, sales turnover, and profitability.

From this population of all firms in Sweden, multiple criteria were used to define a sample of high growth firms (n = 1,501). Using nineteen different measures of firm growth (such as relative and absolute sales growth, relative and absolute employee growth, organic growth versus acquisition growth, and the regularity and volatility of growth rates over the ten year period) we identified seven different types of firm growth patterns. These patterns were related to firm age and size as well as industry affiliation.

These firms are of particular interest because rapid growth is an indication of market acceptance and firm success. By studying rapidgrowth firms, researchers can help all firms better understand the attributes associated with firm growth. Despite these positive outcomes, however, rapid firm growth is difficult to achieve and maintain. This study adds to the literature through a quantitative content analysis of the narrative descriptions of 50 rapid-growth firms and a comparison group of 50 slow-growth companies. The purpose of the study was to draw from the narratives a list of empirically grounded growth-related attributes that are associated with rapid-growth firms.

However, until recently little had been known about restaurant firm growth patterns. Thus, this study examined the growth patterns of restaurant firms in association with firm size class and internationalization, after controlling for total and long-term debt leverage, retained earnings, and growth opportunity. Overall, the results of this study showed that small restaurant firms grow faster than large restaurant firms but the growth rate decreases as firm size increases. Furthermore, the growth rate of large firms decreased more slowly than small firms. In terms of internationalization, this study found that as firm size increases, the growth rate of small international firms decreases more rapidly than that of small domestic firms. However, the growth rate of large international firms decreases more slowly than that of large domestic firms. These findings indicate the appropriateness of internationalization strategies for large restaurant firms but the inappropriateness of these strategies for small firms.

Solutions reviewed in literature are increasingly based on machine learning and deep learning methods for prediction of fault proneness with respect to normal working conditions. Many state-of-the art solutions are not actually applied in real scenarios, and have restrictions to be executed in real-time in the production environment. In this paper, a framework for predictive maintenance is presented. It has been built upon a deep learning model based on Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks, LSTM and Convolutional LSTM. The proposed model provides a one-hour prediction of the plant status and indications on the areas in which the intervention should be performed by using explainable LSTM technique.

A generalized predictive control (GPC) law with integral action is derived based on the minimization of a modified predictive performance criterion. The stability and steady-state performance of the resulting control system are studied as well. Two examples including the control of a nonlinear process and the control of a physical variable-frequency oil-cooling machine are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Such systems require effective control strategies that take these effects into account. Such a control strategy is the nonlinear model predictive (NMPC) controller. However, an NMPC depends very much on the accuracy of the internal model used for prediction in order to maintain feasible operating conditions of the RO desalination plant. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially the Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) can capture complex nonlinear dynamic behavior and provide long-range predictions even in the presence of disturbances. Therefore, in this paper an NMPC for a RO desalination plant that utilizes an LSTM as the predictive model will be presented. It will be tested to maintain a given permeate flow rate and keep the permeate concentration under a certain limit by manipulating the feed pressure. Results show a good performance of the system.\n\n==\n\nWang 2020:\n\nTitle: Deep Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor System\n\nAbstract: A continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) system is widely applied in wastewater treatment processes. Its control is a challenging industrial-process-control problem due to great difficulty to achieve accurate system identification. This work proposes a deep learning-based model predictive control (DeepMPC) to model and control the CSTR system. The proposed DeepMPC consists of a growing deep belief network (GDBN) and an optimal controller. First, GDBN can automatically determine its size with transfer learning to achieve high performance in system identification, and it serves just as a predictive model of a controlled system. The model can accurately approximate the dynamics of the controlled system with a uniformly ultimately bounded error. Second, quadratic optimization is conducted to obtain an optimal controller. This work analyzes the convergence and stability of DeepMPC. Finally, the DeepMPC is used to model and control a second-order CSTR system. In the experiments, DeepMPC shows a better performance in modeling, tracking, and antidisturbance than the other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n==\n\nBieker 2020:\n\nTitle: Deep model predictive flow control with limited sensor data and online learning\n\nAbstract: The control of complex systems is of critical importance in many branches of science, engineering, and industry, many of which are governed by nonlinear partial differential equations. Controlling an unsteady fluid flow is particularly important, as flow control is a key enabler for technologies in energy (e.g., wind, tidal, and combustion), transportation (e.g., planes, trains, and automobiles), security (e.g., tracking airborne contamination), and health (e.g., artificial hearts and artificial respiration). However, the high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multi-scale dynamics make real-time feedback control infeasible. Fortunately, these high-dimensional systems exhibit dominant, low-dimensional patterns of activity that can be exploited for effective control in the sense that knowledge of the entire state of a system is not required. Advances in machine learning have the potential to revolutionize flow control given its ability to extract principled, low-rank feature spaces characterizing such complex systems. We present a novel deep learning model predictive control framework that exploits low-rank features of the flow in order to achieve considerable improvements to control performance. Instead of predicting the entire fluid state, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to accurately predict the control relevant quantities of the system, which are then embedded into an MPC framework to construct a feedback loop. In order to lower the data requirements and to improve the prediction accuracy and thus the control performance, incoming sensor data are used to update the RNN online. The results are validated using varying fluid flow examples of increasing complexity.\n\n==\n\nSantander 2022:\n\nTitle: Deep learning economic model predictive control for refinery operation: A fluid catalytic cracker - fractionator case study\n\nAbstract: An integrated deep learning - economic model predictive control (EMPC) framework for large scale processes is presented.

This paper proposes a deep learning structure and corresponding training algorithm for the purpose of soft sensor, which is called probabilistic sequential network. The proposed model merges unsupervised feature extraction and supervised dynamic modeling approaches to improve the prediction performance. It is mainly based on the Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine and the recurrent neural network structure. To avoid the overfitting problem in the training procedure of deep learning algorithms, the L2 regularization and dropout technique are adopted. The new method can not only deeply extract the nonlinear feature but also widely capture dynamic characteristic of process data.

The state-of-the-art fiducial marker detection algorithms rely on the consistency of the ambient lighting. This article introduces LiDARTag, a novel fiducial tag design and detection algorithm suitable for light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The proposed method runs in real-time and can process data at 100\u00a0Hz, which is faster than the currently available LiDAR sensor frequencies. Because of the LiDAR sensors\u2019 nature, rapidly changing ambient lighting will not affect the detection of a LiDARTag; hence, the proposed fiducial marker can operate in a completely dark environment. In addition, the LiDARTag nicely complements and is compatible with existing visual fiducial markers, such as AprilTags, allowing for efficient multi-sensor fusion and calibration tasks. We further propose a concept of minimizing a fitting error between a point cloud and the marker's template to estimate the marker's pose. The proposed method achieves millimeter error in translation and a few degrees in rotation. Due to LiDAR returns\u2019 sparsity, the point cloud is lifted to a continuous function in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the inner product can be used to determine a marker's ID. The experimental results, verified by a motion capture system, confirm that the proposed method can reliably provide a tag's pose and unique ID code. The rejection of false positives is validated on the Google Cartographer indoor dataset and the Honda H3D outdoor dataset.

In contrast with previous scanning LIDARs, vertical scanning is realized using two stepping motors synchronized with movement and moves in a spiral. From the results of outdoor experiments conducted last year to evaluate and measure the LIDAR performance and stability, we identified some limitations and problems that should be resolved.

Although several approaches have shown promise in their ability to generate narrative, there has been little research on the generation of stories that evoke specific cognitive and affective responses in their readers. The goal of this research is to develop a system that produces a narrative designed specifically to evoke a targeted degree of suspense, a significant contributor to the level of engagement experienced by users of interactive narrative systems. The system that I present takes as input a plan data structure representing the goals of a storyworld's characters and the actions they perform in pursuit of them. Adapting theories developed by cognitive psychologists, my system uses a plan-based model of narrative comprehension to determine the final content of the story in order to manipulate a reader's level of suspense in specific ways. In this thesis, I outline the various components of the system and describe an empirical evaluation that I used to determine the efficacy of my techniques. The evaluation provides strong support for the claim that the system is effective in generating suspenseful stories.\n\n==\n\nDoust 2015:\n\nTitle: A domain-independent model of suspense in narrative\n\nAbstract: Many computational models of narrative have focussed on the structure of the narrative world. Such models have been implemented in a wide variety of systems, often linked to characters\u2019 goals and plans, where the goal of creating suspenseful stories is baked into the structure of each system. There is no portable, independently motivated idea of what makes a suspenseful story. \n \nOur approach is instead to take the phenomenon of suspense as the starting point. We extend an existing psychological model of narrative by Brewer and Lichtenstein (1982) which postulates suspense, curiosity and surprise as the fundamental elements of entertaining stories. We build a formal model of these phenomena using structures we call narrative threads. \n \nNarrative threads are a formal description of a reader\u2019s expectations about what might happen next in a given story. Our model uses a measure for the imminence of the predicted conflict between narrative threads to create a suspense profile for a given story. We also identify two types of suspense: conflict-based and revelatory suspense. \n \nWe tested the validity of our model by asking participants to give step- by-step self-reported suspense levels on reading online story variants. The results show that the normalised average scores of participants (N = 46) are in agreement with the values predicted by our model to a high level of statistical significance. \n \nOur model\u2019s interface with storyworld knowledge is compatible with recent developments in automatic harvesting of world knowledge in the form of event chains such as Chambers and Jurafsky (2008). This means that it is in principle scalable. By disentangling suspense from specific narrative content and planning strategies, we arrive at a domain-independent model that can be reused within different narrative generation systems. We see our work as a signpost to encourage the further development of narrative models based on what we see as its fundamental ingredients.\n\n==\n\nIndrusiak 2018:\n\nTitle: Narrative Suspense in Edgar Allan Poe and Alfred Hitchcock\n\nAbstract: This article explores the construction of narrative suspense in Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s and Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s works. Central to their creations is a dual narrative structure that builds tension by articulating two stories in one. Narratological analyses of Poe\u2019s tales and of Hitchcock\u2019s thrillers indicate that their suspense does not stem from gothic topoi, but from plots skilfully wrought to manipulate the readers/viewers\u2019 attention. The first part of the article introduces the concept of narrative suspense. Next, structural principles defended by Poe and Hitchcock are presented. The last two parts discuss narrative techniques in the works by both authors. Given the authors\u2019 influence within their respective media, the analysis has implications for studies of the short story and of the suspense thriller as a narrative genre.\n\n==\n\nKhrypko 2011:\n\nTitle: Towards the problem of maintaining suspense in interactive narrative\n\nAbstract: The paper introduces the problem of creating and maintaining suspense in interactive narrative.

While current theories of suspense are suspense realist theories, I argue for a suspense eliminativist theory according to which suspense is not itself a genuine, distinct emotion but a subspecies of an emotion, or the class comprising all and only those subspecies, chiefly demarcated by the necessity of uncertainty and primarily the province of (primarily fictional) narrative encounters. There are several prima facie compelling reasons to think suspense eliminativism is capable of grounding a theory equally if not better able to resolve the principal concerns suspense theory must address.\n\n==\n\nVorderer 2009:\n\nTitle: Suspense : Conceptualizations, Theoretical Analyses, and Empirical Explorations\n\nAbstract: Contents: Preface.

Core competencies in general are linked with job productivity, job performance, and organisational performance. In Malaysia, initiatives are currently underway to produce competent and professional Halal executives. As for now, the competencies of halal executives are yet to be defined. Defining and identifying the core competencies is pivotal as the Malaysian Halal industry needs to appoint more competent halal executives to serve the halal-certified companies. Thus, this article aims to identify the set of competencies for halal executives via a literature review. This would allow for the further development of the Halal executive core competencies conceptual model. In addition, the background of Halal executives in the Malaysian Halal industry is also discussed to provide context for this review article. The conceptual model proposed is useful in discussing and developing the idea of core competencies, especially in the halal manufacturing industry context. A comprehensive core competencies model is useful for preparing future halal executives, evaluating halal executives' practises in the workplace, and for their lifelong professional development. Other countries could use the same core competencies framework to inform the development of the human resource related to Halal.\n\n==\n\nAhmad 2019:\n\nTitle: Disequilibrium and Divinity Salience as Invariant Structures in The Halal Executives\u2019 Experience of Eudaimonia\n\nAbstract: The global Halal industry is large and continues to grow as the global Muslim population increases in size and dispersion. There are 1.84 billion Muslims today spread over 200 countries and is expected to increase to 2.2 billion by 2030. The industry will be worth USD6.4 trillion by the end of 2018 with more non-traditional players and emergent markets. The stakes are high with pressures to generate novel and sustainable practices. This goes beyond systems and hard skills as it needs to cut into the self \u2013 the person of virtues in virtuous acts, not because they \u201chave to\u201d but because it is the purpose of humankind or his telos - to be \u201cliving well\u201d and \u201cacting well\u201d or eudaimonia.

However, the call to certify products and practices formally, and subsequently then label them has given rise to a new cultural phenomenon. Demands to carry overt labels and messages; and expectations as to what Halal is and should be are on the increase inside and outside of Muslim geographies across the globe. For economic and technological reasons, this is also transferring the domain of halal more and more to a vanguard of businesses; as opposed to being just a religious imperative driven by the clergy. Furthermore, the current landscape of the halal industry has arrived at a crossroads: where debates consider whether halal offers opportunities for product and brand extensions, rendering it as a niche marketing approach; or if in fact it presents the opportunity to create a new business paradigm. This article offers practitioners and academics an overview and insight into an industry that has been assessed as having a worldwide value of USD $2.3 trillion.\n\n==\n\nWilson 2012:\n\nTitle: Charting the rise of the halal market \u2013 tales from the field and looking forward\n\nAbstract: Purpose \u2013 To present a real-world industry perspective on the Halal market, which sits within several industry sectors, across the globe \u2013 with the aim of capturing expert knowledge and stimulating further research areas. \n \nMethodology/approach \u2013 Iterative face-to-face and email interviews with two international key experts and conference organisers in the halal sector, over a period of eight weeks. These were supported by naturalistic observation methods at the 2012 World Halal Forum, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A phenomenological approach was taken, which encouraged subjects to reflect longitudinally on critical moments and turning points. \n \nFindings \u2013 It is clear that the stakeholders in the Halal constitute a new kind of industry in their own right: a diverse, complex, yet integrated industry - with a global reach that crosses geographic, cultural and even religious boundaries. The Halal industry intersects and shares common values with many other industry sectors and yet it has a unique set of issues and concerns that are specific to the Halal market. In the face of these factors, the field is still relatively in its infancy \u2013 meaning that currently there are gaps in knowledge, differences in opinion and key concerns; which looking to the future need to be addressed through continuous structured debate and dialogue. \n \nImplications \u2013 Derived from the findings, it appears that the Halal sector is in need of further detailed research: across the Halal supply chain; which tackles contentious issues of legislation and Islamic jurisprudence in the modern global market; and faithfully captures the consumer experience. \n \nOriginality/Value \u2013 This paper provides insight into the Halal sector across territories and sectors, which is of value to practitioners and researchers.\n\n==\n\nHanzaee 2011:\n\nTitle: Intention To Halal Products In The World Markets\n\nAbstract: Emphasis on the importance of halal products is now growing. It is fast becoming a new market force and brand identifier and is now moving into the mainstream market, affecting and changing perception on how business should be conducted, including from a marketing point of view. Halal is no longer just purely a religious issue. It is in the realm of business and trade, and it is becoming a global symbol for quality assurance and lifestyle choice. Halal products are those that are Shariah compliant, i.e. do not involve the use of haram (prohibited) ingredients, exploitation of labor or environment, and are not harmful or intended for harmful use. The realm of halal may extend to all consumables such as toiletries, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and services including finance. Halal is a typical credence process attribute, i.e. a quality characteristic that can hardly be evaluated or ascertained by the individual consumer, even upon or after consuming the food. Nowadays, Muslims are making their presence felt socially and politically and are requesting halal-certified food products. Currently, a certain degree of assurance is provided by halal certification of halal products. There are two types of halal certificates, and their duration depends on the type of food or beverage. Any individual Muslim, Islamic organization or agency can issue a halal certificate, but the acceptability of the certificate depends upon the country of import or the Muslim community served through such certification. With the complexity of manufacturing systems and the utilization of all animal by products, any product consumed by Muslims may be certified, whether the product is consumed internally or applied to the body externally. The halal certification process starts with choosing an organization that meets the needs for the markets to be serviced. The halal logo is an authoritative, independent and reliable testimony to support halal food claims. This conceptually-based paper critically reviews and amalgamates a diverse range of literature concerning Islamic rules. The way that organizations issue halal certificates for halal producers and use of the halal logo on products. In addition, the paper utilizes necessary religion sources and legal documents. The halal concept (especially for foods) is truly from the farm to the table, and requires nutritious items prepared from permissible ingredients in a clean and hygienic manner. Muslim consumers are very similar to any other consumer segments, demanding healthy and quality products, which must also conform to Shariah requirements. Halal certificate can play an important role to assure consumers that the product has got the necessary conditions of halal product.\n\n==\n\nMarzuki 2012:\n\nTitle: Restaurant Manager and Halal Certification in Malaysia\n\nAbstract: Halal certification at restaurants ensures that foods are served according to Islamic dietary laws. Halal means permitted or lawful or fit for consumption. The purpose of this study is to explore the attributes of halal certification among Malaysian restaurant managers. A national mail survey was conducted on 2,080 respondents along with 33 interviews in 4 selected states and in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur. The results indicate that restaurant managers have high expectations toward halal certification as it signifies attributes such as trust, safety, hygiene, and also perceived by participants as an important aspect in the food service industry.\n\n==\n\nBohari 2013:\n\nTitle: An analysis on the competitiveness of halal food industry inMalaysia: an approach of SWOT and ICT strategy\n\nAbstract: The halal food industry is vital important to the world wide Muslims to ensure hygiene, cleanliness and not detrimental to their health and well-being in whatever they consume, use and purchase. Theoretically, halal is possible to be the benchmark for quality with specifically refers whatever is permitted by Syariah Islamiah and applies to every activity carried out by mankind. Practically, halal when used in relation to the business sector, it refers to business operation and conducted in a manner deemed permissible in Islam. Meanwhile, current development shows that the halal food industry has become one of important sectors that contributes to the societal development as well as it contributes to the national growth. The objective of the present paper is to analyze the competitiveness of business environment of halal food industry in Malaysia. The main method that used are PEST and SWOT analysis where each factors that are related to \nthe halal food industry will be screened and evaluated of it importance. In addition, ICT-based strategy will be recommended on the halal food industry to enhance their current competitive forces as well as preparation for future challenges of the industry.\n\n==\n\nFischer 2016:\n\nTitle: Manufacturing halal in Malaysia\n\nAbstract: In Arabic, halal literally means \u2018permissible\u2019 or \u2018lawful\u2019. Halal is no longer an expression of an esoteric form of production, trade and consumption, but part of a huge and expanding globalized market in which certification, standards and technoscience play important roles. Over the past three decades, Malaysia has become a world leader in the global expansion of halal markets. This has come about in large part because the state and government of Malaysia have taken on the role of halal-certifying authority within the country. In effect, it has certified, standardized and bureaucratized halal production, trade and consumption. Based on fieldwork in Malaysia, this article explores how manufacturing companies understand and practise halal certification, standards and technoscience. I argue that while existing studies of halal overwhelmingly explore micro-social aspects such as the everyday consumption among Muslim groups, \u2018the bigger institutional picture\u2019 that frames such consumption production and regulation are not well understood. By studying halal production, I provide an ethnography of the overlapping technologies and techniques of production and regulation that together warrant a product as \u2018halal\u2019 and thereby help to format the market.", "final_summary": "The concept of a \"halal executive\" is a relatively new and evolving field, primarily focused on the management and certification of halal products and services. \n\nRosli (2022) emphasizes the importance of competent halal executives in the Halal Management System, particularly in food manufacturing companies.

Rather than focus on profits, they have chased customers indiscriminately through discounting, channel incentives, and advertising. Rather than concentrate on delivering value that earns an attractive price from customers, they have pursued indirect revenues such as advertising and click-through fees. Rather than make trade-offs, they have rushed to offer every conceivable product or service. It did not have to be this way--and it does not have to be in the future. When it comes to reinforcing a distinctive strategy, Michael Porter argues, the Internet provides a better technological platform than previous generations of IT. Gaining competitive advantage does not require a radically new approach to business; it requires building on the proven principles of effective strategy. Porter argues that, contrary to recent thought, the Internet is not disruptive to most existing industries and established companies. It rarely nullifies important sources of competitive advantage in an industry; it often makes them even more valuable. And as all companies embrace Internet technology, the Internet itself will be neutralized as a source of advantage. Robust competitive advantages will arise instead from traditional strengths such as unique products, proprietary content, and distinctive physical activities. Internet technology may be able to fortify those advantages, but it is unlikely to supplant them. Porter debunks such Internet myths as first-mover advantage, the power of virtual companies, and the multiplying rewards of network effects. He disentangles the distorted signals from the marketplace, explains why the Internet complements rather than cannibalizes existing ways of doing business, and outlines strategic imperatives for dot-coms and traditional companies.\n\n==\n\nCinca 2003:\n\nTitle: An approach to the measurement of intangible assets in dot com\n\nAbstract: A sample of 40 firms that operate on the Internet is studied to explore ways of\nidentifying and measuring intangible assets in this area of business.

However, relatively little is known about how managers can go about achieving this transformation, and how, and to what extent, different types of business models should be adapted. To illustrate the differential effect of environmental changes on different business model types, this article draws from the \u20184C\u2019 Internet business model typology to elaborate on how a recent wave of changes on the Internet - the emergent Web 2.0 phenomenon - is affecting each of its four business model types. We argue that Web 2.0 trends and characteristics are changing the rules of the \u2018create and capture value\u2019 game, and thus significantly disrupt the effectiveness of established Internet business models. Since systematic empirical knowledge about Web 2.0 factors is very limited, a comprehensive Web 2.0 framework is developed, which is illustrated with two cases and verified through in-depth interviews with Internet business managers. Strategic recommendations on how to what extent different Web 2.0 aspects affect each business model type are developed. Executives can use the ideas and frameworks presented in the article to benchmark their firm\u2019s efforts towards embracing the changes associated with the Web 2.0 into their business model.

In many cases, though, internet-based businesses pursue customer growth ahead of profits. The path to profitability, which is a core element of a business model, should not be an afterthought. A well-designed business model balances the provision of value to customers with the capture of value by the provider. The elements of a business model and the dynamic capabilities that help design, implement, and refine a model for an organization and its business ecosystem are reviewed.

The conclusion has been reached that despite all the endeavours to limit arms violence it basically remained unmitigated.\n\n==\n\nDowning 1992:\n\nTitle: The Military Revolution and Political Change: Origins of Democracy and Autocracy in Early Modern Europe\n\nAbstract: To examine the long-run origins of democracy and dictatorship, Brian Downing focuses on the importance of medieval political configurations and of military modernization in the early modern period. He maintains that in late medieval times an array of constitutional arrangements distinguished Western Europe from other parts of the world and predisposed it toward liberal democracy. He then looks at how medieval constitutionalism was affected by the \"military revolution\" of the early modern era--the shift from small, decentralized feudal levies to large standing armies. Downing won the American Political Science Association's Gabriel Almond Award for the dissertation on which this book was based.\n\n==\n\nAyton 1995:\n\nTitle: The Medieval military revolution : state, society and military change in medieval and early modern Europe\n\nAbstract: Introduction: the military revolution from a medieval perspective, Andrew Ayton, J.L.

Regarding military service, the Middle Ages are occasionally suggested as an age when combat was sporadic, when only the small feudal aristocracy encountered a martial obligation, and when the remainder of society could concentrate on the other burdens of life, free of the paraphernalia of war, hot or cold. As with many romantic generalizations concerning the period, the comparative bliss of the medieval non-combatant is open to question. Many would note, however, that the feudal classes did possess a monopoly on warfare for several centuries in parts of Continental Europe, and would tend to place all discussion of military institutions within a feudal context.\n\n==\n\nNicholson 2004:\n\nTitle: Medieval Warfare: Theory and Practice of War in Europe, 300-1500\n\nAbstract: Warfare in medieval times was never static or predictable - although there were ideals and conventions to follow, in the field commanders had to use their initiative and adapt to the needs of the moment.

However, the currently developed electrochemical sensors are only applicable for single-element analysis of Pb2+ or Hg2+. Herein, a dual signal interface was realized by in-situ grafting the signal tags (Melamine-Cu2+ complex and Nile blue) bearing different redox potentials on the terminal of PBA and HBA that were co-immobilized on gold electrode. The results show that the interface has two pairs of independent redox peaks, ascribing to the melamine-Cu2+ complex and Nile blue, respectively. The sensor is not only applicable for single-element detection of Pb2+ or Hg2+, but also for simultaneous detection of them. The surface density of PBA and HBA on the gold electrode and the grafting efficiency of the electroactive tags on the aptamers have been determined. The detection limits for Pb2+ and Hg2+ were estimated to be 0.98 pM and 19 pM, respectively. The dual signal sensor is successfully applied for Pb2+ and Hg2+ determination in real water samples, showing its potential in the environmental monitoring of Pb2+ and Hg2+.\n\n==\n\nLiao 2015:\n\nTitle: Development of a new electrochemical sensor for determination of Hg(II) based on Bis(indolyl)methane/Mesoporous carbon nanofiber/Nafion/glassy carbon electrode\n\nAbstract: Abstract A new BIM/MCNF/Nafion-modified glassy carbon electrode, combining the specific Hg 2+ -complexing ability of bis(indolyl)methane (BIM) with the unique properties of mesoporous carbon nanofiber (MCNF), was fabricated for anodic stripping analysis of Hg 2+ . BIM was synthesized and served as an ionophore for highly selective adsorption heavy metal Hg 2+ from the sample solution. MCNF displayed extraordinary electrical conductivity and great adsorption ability to enhance the sensitivity of the modified electrode. Nafion, a sulfonated cation-exchange polymer, supplied the good stability of the modifying layer. The as-prepared electrochemical sensor significantly improved selectivity and sensitivity towards Hg 2+ determination. The stripping current increased linearly with Hg 2+ concentration at the range of 5\u2013500\u00a0nM under 15\u00a0min accumulation at open-circuit potential, with a detection limit of 0.3\u00a0nM. Meanwhile, the proposed electrode could avoid some interference of other heavy metal ions coexisting with Hg 2+ , such as Cd 2+ , Pb 2+ and Cu 2+ . This new method has been successfully applied for the detection of Hg 2+ in Yellow River with satisfactory results.\n\n==\n\nLu 2016:\n\nTitle: Novel electrochemical sensing platform for quantitative monitoring of Hg(II) on DNA-assembled graphene oxide with target recycling.\n\nAbstract: This work designs a new electrochemical sensing platform for the quantitative monitoring of mercury ion (Hg(2+)) on poly-T(15) oligonucleotide-functionalized graphene oxide by coupling with DNase I-assisted target recycling amplification. The assay was carried out on the basis of T-Hg(2+)-T coordination chemistry by using target-induced dissociation of indicator-labeled poly-T(15) oligonucleotide from graphene oxide nanosheets. The electronic signal was amplified through DNase I-triggered target recycling. Experimental results indicated that the amperometric response of DNA-based sensing platform deceased with the increasing Hg(2+) concentration in the sample, and has a detection limit of 0.12nM with a dynamic working range of up to 50nM. Our strategy afforded exquisite selectivity for Hg(2+) against other environmentally related metal ions. More significantly, this methodology displayed high reproducibility and acceptable accuracy, thus representing an optional sensing scheme for the screening of Hg(2+) in environmental water samples.\n\n==\n\nKatseli 2020:\n\nTitle: Miniature 3D-printed integrated electrochemical cell for trace voltammetric Hg(II) determination\n\nAbstract: Abstract This work describes an integrated miniature all-3D-printed device for the determination of trace Hg(II) by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). The device is fabricated through a single-step printing process using a dual-extruder 3D printer and is composed of a mini vessel (printed from a polylactic acid (PLA) filament) and of 3 thermoplastic electrodes printed from a carbon-loaded PLA conductive filament and integrated at the bottom of the vessel. The working electrode surface is modified with a thin gold film electroplated in situ. The formation of the gold deposit was studied by linear sweep voltammetry and optical microscopy and the electrode materials as well as the chemical and instrumental conditions for Hg(II) determination were optimized. The limit of detection for Hg(II) is 0.52\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121, the within-sensor repeatability (expressed as the coefficient of variation of 8 measurements of 20\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121 Hg(II) at the same device) is 3.9 % and the between-cell reproducibility (expressed as the coefficient of variation 5 measurements of 20\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121 Hg(II) conducted at different cells) is 8.9 %.

While gold-palladium modified zirconium metal-organic frameworks (AuPd@UiO-67) nanozyme was employed as signal enhancer for detecting mercury ions (Hg2+) sensitively. Herein, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were modified on HS-rGO to form the thin Au@HS-rGO layer. Then the substrate strand (Apt1) was modified on the platform through Au-S bond. The signal strand (Apt2) was further decorated on the platform in the presence of Hg2+. Herein, the Apt2 was labeled with AuPd@UiO-67 nanozyme, which exhibited catalase-like properties to catalyze H2O2, thereby generating the electrical signal. With the concentration of Hg2+ increased, the amount of modified Apt2-AuPd@UiO-67 increased, leading to the rise of current response. Since the current responses were linear with concentration of Hg2+, the detection of Hg2+ can be achieved. Under the optimum conditions, the prepared electrochemical aptasensor exhibited wide linear range from 1.0\u00a0nmol/L to 1.0\u00a0mmol/L, along with a low detection limit of 0.16\u00a0nmol/L. Moreover, the electrochemical aptasensor showed excellent selectivity, reproducibility and stability, together with superior performance in actual water sample analysis. Therefore, this proposed electrochemical aptasensor may have promising applications and provide references for environmental monitoring and management.\n\n==\n\nYu 2004:\n\nTitle: Surface plasmon resonance sensor for Hg(II) detection by binding interactions with polypyrrole and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole\n\nAbstract: Abstract A SPReeta sensor was developed for Hg(II) detection by monitoring the binding interactions with polypyrrole (PPy) and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (2-MBT). Chemical binding of Hg2+ ions in water with a PPy thin film immobilized on the gold surface could be monitored by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The SPR angle was found to be a useful analytical signal for monitoring the binding interaction. An increase in SPR angle of 780\u00b110\u00a0RU (1 RU=1\u00d710\u22124\u00b0) was obtained for 10\u00a0ppm Hg2+ biding with PPy film, and a linear dynamic range was observed between 0.1 and 10\u00a0ppm. After Hg2+ absorption into the polymer, enhancement of the SPR detection sensitivity was achieved by adding 2-MBT to the injected solution. This produced further binding interaction with the Hg2+ bound on PPy. The detection limit was improved down to 0.01\u00a0ppm with a SPR angle increase of 20\u00b110\u00a0RU. It should be recognized that both 2-MBT and PPy worked together in the present SPReeta method to enhance the specificity of Hg2+ determination.\n\n==\n\nZeng 2017:\n\nTitle: Practical and regenerable electrochemical aptasensor based on nanoporous gold and thymine-Hg2+-thymine base pairs for Hg2+ detection.\n\nAbstract: A simple, practical and reusable electrochemical aptasensor, based on thymine-Hg2+-thymine (T-Hg2+-T) coordination chemistry and nanoporous gold (NPG) for signal amplification, was designed for sensitive and selective detection of mercury ions (Hg2+). The thiol modified T-rich hairpin capture probe was self-assembled onto the surface of the NPG modified electrode for hybridizing with ferrocene-labeled T-rich probe in the presence of Hg2+ via T-Hg2+-T coordination chemistry. As a result, the hairpin capture probe was opened, and the ferrocene tags were close to the NPG modified electrode. Taking advantage of the amplification effect of NPG electrode for increasing the reaction sites of thiol modified capture probe, the proposed electrochemical aptasensor could detect Hg2+ quantitatively in the range of 0.01-5000nM, with a detection limit as low as 0.0036nM which is much lower than the maximum contamination level for Hg2+ in drinking water defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Moreover, the proposed electrochemical aptasensor can be regenerated by adding cysteine and Mg2+. The aptasensor was also used to detect Hg2+ from real water samples, and the results showed excellent agreement with the values determined by atomic fluorescence spectrometer. This aptasensor showed a promising potential for on-site detecting Hg2+ in drinking water.\n\n==\n\nChu-mong 2016:\n\nTitle: A FRET based aptasensor coupled with non-enzymatic signal amplification for mercury (II) ion detection.\n\nAbstract: In this work, the idea of incorporating a non-enzymatic signal amplification with a regular aptasensor was tested. In this proof of principle, the sensor was designed for the detection of mercury (II) ions (Hg(2+)) based on the F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), and the catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) technique that was used as the signal amplification method. This sensor comprised a mercury aptamer-catalyst complex (Apt-C) and two types of hairpin DNA: H1 labeled with fluorescein and H2 labeled with tetramethylrhodamine. In the presence of Hg(2+), two facing thymine bases in the mercury aptamer strand were coordinated with one mercury ion. This caused the release of the catalyst for the catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction that turned H1 and H2 hairpins into H1-H2 hybrids. FRET was then used to report the hairpin-duplex transformation. The sensor showed excellent specificity towards Hg(2+) over other possible interfering cations present at even a 100 fold greater concentrations. It had a linear range of 10.0-200.0nM, and a good detection limit of 7.03\u00b10.18nM, which is lower than the regulatory mercury limit for drinking water (10nM or 2ppb). The sensor was used to detect spiked Hg(2+) in nine real surface water samples collected from three different areas. Acceptable recoveries and small standard deviations indicated that the sensor was practically applicable, and the proposed idea to incorporate a CHA amplification in a regular aptasensor was not only feasible but beneficial.

Its density ranges between 2.4 g/cm3 and 2.95 g/cm3, averaging 2.67 g/cm3. It has a Moh's scale hardness of 2. Authigenic glauconite is formed under a limited range of geologic and geochemical conditions; it typically develops on the outer margins of continental shelves, in areas of low sediment input (Odin, 1980), and its presence is valuable as an indicator of transgressive sequences.\n\nIdentifying glauconite in the subsurface is important for depositional environment interpretation, stratigraphic correlation, dating, tracing of unconformities, and geochemical exploration for source and reservoir rocks (Srivastava, 1986). A number of commercial hydrocarbon reservoirs are glauconitic sandstones\u2014for example in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Australia, Eastern China, North Sea, United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Ireland.\n\nAlthough glauconite tends to exist as grains and as such is part of the rock framework, under moderate overburden pressure, these grains are easily compacted (Figure 1) and may form a pseudomatrix that occludes the original primary porosity. This behavior is in contrast to that observed in clay minerals. This problem, and the fact that there are no published studies about the elastic properties of glauconite and glauconitic sandstones, motivated this research to understand their rock physics properties.

Chemical analysis of these different fabrics reveals a strong association between glauconite and phosphate occurring on a sub-microscopic scale. Despite this intimate association, certain deductions may be made about the mineralogy of the glauconite (notably the K concentration) and its relationship to its morphology. Glauconite and phosphate formation took place in the transitional zone between oxic and anoxic environments (suboxic zone). Iron oxyhydroxides were a potential source of phosphorus and iron, while 'sulphide fluxing' maintained pH levels appropriate for carbonate dissolution and subsequent mineralisation.\n\n==\n\nMcRae 1975:\n\nTitle: The presence of indigenous glauconite in soils and its effect on soil fertility:II. Soils developed on Gault Clay (Denchworth series)\n\nAbstract: SUMMARY Twelve stagnogley soils of the Denchworth series from East Kent were studied to determine the effect of indigenous glauconite on their fertility. The presence or absence of glauconite was not the major factor controlling the potassium or magnesium status which was largely determined by the nature of the < 2 \u03bcm clay. Glauconitic soils had much higher levels of available phosphate than corresponding non-glauconitic soils due to calcium phosphate associated with the glauconite in the parent material. Weathering has partially converted this to aluminium and iron phosphates which were the main forms of phosphate present, especially in the A (0\u201315 cm) horizons.", "final_summary": "The pH of glauconite in soils has been a topic of interest in various studies. Kisiel (2018) provides a unique case of glauconite weathering in an alkaline environment. However, the paper does not provide specific pH values for the samples. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that glauconite in soils commonly exists in alkaline conditions. Further research is needed to confirm this and provide specific pH ranges in different soil types and environments."}, {"query": "\"supply chain demand risk\" theory", "paper_list_string": "Trkman 2009:\n\nTitle: Supply Chain Risk in Turbulent Environments \u2013 A Conceptual Model for Managing Supply Chain Network Risk\n\nAbstract: Supply risk or the likelihood of supply disruptions is emerging as a key challenge to supply chain management. The ability to identify which supplier has greater potential of a disruption is a critical first step in managing the frequency and impact of these disruptions that often significantly impact on the supply chain. This paper presents preliminary research concepts regarding a new approach to the identification and prediction of supply risk. This approach to the assessment and classification of suppliers is based on supplier's attributes, performances and supply chain characteristics, while it is also modified by factors in the supplier's specific environment. The challenges posed to supply chains due to a turbulent environment (both from within the industry and external influences) are examined. A new method for the assessment and classification of suppliers based on their characteristics, performances and the environment of the industry in which they operate is presented. The findings are explained within the contingency theory.\n\n==\n\nMandal 2012:\n\nTitle: Conceptualizing a Model for Demand -Side Risk in Supply Chain\n\nAbstract: With growing competition and dynamicity in the tastes and preferences of customers, there is a recent growth in the number of supply chain disruptions as well; for e.g. the recent flood in Thailand affecting the global operations of hard-disk manufacturers like Seagate, Western Digital to car makers Honda and Toyota. Thus an increased need is felt by these firms to adopt effective risk mitigation strategies which have further increased the necessity of studying several types of risk inherent in the supply chains and corresponding significant variables affecting each of them. Till date, there is no study conceptualizing a framework for measuring exclusively each of the risk types inherent in the supply chain. The present study attempts to formulate a framework for managing demand side risk from a supply chain perspective for a focal firm through structured literature review and have contributed by adding important predictors like trust towards customer, trust towards suppliers, and relationship quality with suppliers, relationship quality with customers and information sharing with suppliers with the existing ones like supplier dependence, customer dependence, supplier concentration, single sourcing and global sourcing.\n\n==\n\nXiao-wo 2013:\n\nTitle: Transmission Analysis of Demand and Exchange Rate Risks in the Supply Chain\n\nAbstract: The main purpose of this study is to investigate how demand risk and exchange rate risk are transmitted in a supply chain consisting of a supplier,a manufacturer and a retailer.In the supply chain the manufacturer buys materials from the supplier and sells them to the retailer via wholesale price contracts.The demand risk roots in the uncertainty of final market demand while the exchange rate risk stems from the assumption that the manufacturer and the retailer operate in different countries.Under the assumption the manufacturer's revenue per product sold is susceptible to exchange rate fluctuation. To examine risk transmission in the supply chain,weconstruct a two-stage game model to assess the strategic interactions among those three supply chain members.In the model,the manufacturer offers wholesale prices to retailer and supplier in stage 1.The supplier and the retailer simultaneously respond to the manufacturer' offers in stage 2 via an order quality and a supply quantity,respectively.In our proposed model,the demand risk is defined as a process where based the observed final market demand.The retailer strategically orders from the manufacturer and then forces(via the equilibrium of the game model) the manufacturer and the supplier to adjust their profit according to the final market demand.The exchange rate risk refers to when faced with volatile fluctuation of exchange rate the manufacturer strategically offers wholesale prices to the retailer and the supplier respectively and then forces(via the equilibrium of the game model) the retailer and the supplier to vary their profits according to the exchange rate. With the model equilibrium,we measure the risk that the retailer,the manufacturer and the supplier bearwith the variance of their equilibrium profit.We further conduct a statistical analysis of the variance of the final market demand and the exchange rate.The results show that(1) the expected profit of the retailer,the manufacturer and the supplier increases along with the variance of the final demand and exchange rate;(2) the profit variance of the retailer,the manufacturer and the supplier increases along with the variance of the final demand and exchange rate;(3) the relative risks between the retailer and the manufacturer(measured by the ratio of the retailer's profit variance to the manufacturer's profit variance) increases in the slope of the market demand function(a higher slope indicates a lower degree of the flexibility of the retailer's response to price changes in the final market) while the relative risk between the supplier and the manufacturer(measured by the ratio of the supplier's profit variance to the manufacturer's profit variance) increases in the slope of the supplier's margin cost function(a higher slope indicates a lower degree of the flexibility of the supplier's response to the manufacturer's price changes). To summarize,the demand risk and the exchange rate risk can be transmitted in a supply chain viasupply chain partners' strategic interactions.Moreover,the risk transmission in a supply chain depends on both the bullwhip effect and supply chain partners' profit margins.\n\n==\n\nGurtu 2021:\n\nTitle: Supply Chain Risk Management: Literature Review\n\nAbstract: The risks associated with global supply chain management has created a discourse among practitioners and academics. This is evident by the business uncertainties growing in supply chain management, which pose threats to the entire network flow and economy. This paper aims to review the existing literature on risk factors in supply chain management in an uncertain and competitive business environment. Papers that contained the word \u201crisk\u201d in their titles, keywords, or abstracts were selected for conducting the theoretical analyses. Supply chain risk management is an integral function of the supply network. It faces unpredictable challenges due to nations\u2019 economic policies and globalization, which have raised uncertainty and challenges for supply chain organizations. These significantly affect the financial performance of the organizations and the economy of a nation. Debate on supply chain risk management may promote competitiveness in business.

The model consists of three tiers of decision-makers: the manufacturers, the distributors, and the retailers, with the demands associated with the retail outlets being random. We model the optimizing behavior of the various decision-makers, with the manufacturers and the distributors being multicriteria decision-makers and concerned with both profit maximization and risk minimization. We derive the equilibrium conditions and establish the finite-dimensional variational inequality formulation. We provide qualitative properties of the equilibrium pattern in terms of existence and uniqueness results and also establish conditions under which the proposed computational procedure is guaranteed to converge. We illustrate the supply chain network model through several numerical examples for which the equilibrium prices and product shipments are computed. This is the first multitiered supply chain network equilibrium model with electronic commerce and with supply side and demand side risk for which modeling, qualitative analysis, and computational results have been obtained.\n\n==\n\nDu 2012:\n\nTitle: Supply chain wholesale price contract and risk hedge strategy under risk of demand and exchange rate\n\nAbstract: Jointly consider the demand risk and exchange rate risk of the global supply chain.

The results show that the manufacturer's original wholesale price and the incentive degree are unaffected by exchange rate and demand exogenous fluctuation. The retailer's order quantity is unaffected by exchange rate exogenous fluctuation, but decreases with an increase in the demand exogenous fluctuation. The retailer's exchange rate risk exposure proportion decreases with an increase in the exchange rate exogenous fluctuation, and increases with an increase in the demand exogenous fluctuation. The results indicate that the retailer's exchange rate risk hedge strategy can stabilize the supply chain operation strategy.", "final_summary": "The concept of \"supply chain demand risk\" theory is a multifaceted topic that has been explored extensively in the literature.

Hong Kong and Taiwan best illustrate the changing social and economic conditions that have given rise to this conflict. In these two societies, people have demonstrated a strong emphasis on work, even when it entails the sacrifice of family tasks and duties. An array of informal and formal services have been mobilized to allow people to fulfill their duties to work and family. Based on surveys conducted in Hong Kong and Taiwan in late 2009, this paper investigated F/WC and life satisfaction. Specifically, it examined changing life aspirations, both material and non-material, as predictors of F/WC and life satisfaction. The surveys found that respondents had high aspirations for both their family and their work, and for both material and non-material assets, and that they experienced high-level F/WC. Based on the statistical analysis, we argue that minimizing the interference of family life on work and emphasizing non-material life aspirations could promote better life satisfaction.\n\n==\n\nWelsch 2008:\n\nTitle: The Social Costs of Civil Conflict: Evidence from Surveys of Happiness\n\nAbstract: This paper uses data on stated subjective well-being to capture the intangible costs of civil conflict. By running cross-national regressions with happiness as the dependent variable, and the number of conflict victims and income as explanatory variables, it investigates if and in which way civil conflict affects happiness, and derives the implied monetary equivalent of the unhappiness caused. The paper finds that the number of conflict victims and their change over time significantly affect subjective well-being directly through health and psychic effects as well as indirectly through reduced income. The non-pecuniary effects are found to be larger than the income-related effect. A change over time in the number of victims has a stronger impact on well-being than the current number.

The resulting formulation is very elegant from the geometrical viewpoint, since it allows to cast the main postulates of the theory in terms of two geometric structures, namely a symplectic structure and a Riemannian metric. However, the superposition principle of quantum mechanics is not naturally incorporated, since the quantum state space is non-linear. In this note we offer some steps to incorporate the superposition principle within the geometric description. In this respect, we argue that it is necessary to make the distinction between a projective superposition principle and a decomposition principle that should replace the standard superposition principle. We illustrate our proposal with two very well known examples, namely the spin 1/2 system and the two slit experiment, where the distinction is clear.\n\n==\n\nMobley 2005:\n\nTitle: A Reexamination of Time and Special Relativity Assuming a Constant Speed for Quantum Subcomponents.\n\nAbstract: Special relativity is reexamined assuming a new postulate \u2014 that the most fundamental, dimensionless subcomponents of matter travel with the same speed relative to all fixed points of reference \u2014 the speed of light. This postulate corresponds to an alternative definition of time, equating time with the spatial displacement of these subcomponents. Time is motion. This motion is found to correlate with the intrinsic spin and quantized angular momentum associated with elementary particles. The invariant properties of this motion are used to define our equations for time and space relativity in the same manner that the constancy of the speed of light was used by Einstein to generate the equations of special relativity. The predictions are nearly identical to special relativity. Interestingly, the transformation equations create the appearance of additional compactified spatial dimensions. Through modeling the action of interconnecting strings linking these subcomponents, the concepts of simultaneity and action at a distance are developed in relation to the proper time of a quantum particle. The force accelerating these subcomponents is used to derive the energy of formation, consistent with the mass-energy relations of special relativity and quantum theory. The uncertainty principle can be related to the time and space uncertainties in measuring the location of these subcomponents. Thus this alternative conceptual approach can provide a useful starting point for an alternative integration of time, relativity, and quantum theories.\n\n==\n\nGudder 1970:\n\nTitle: A Superposition Principle in Physics\n\nAbstract: A superposition principle is considered both in classical mechanics and in the quantum logic approach to quantum mechanics.

Any interpretation of a spin and isotopic spin of electron requires at least three additional spatial dimensions. As applied to six-dimensional space, the simplest interpretation of the Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainties relation, de Broglie waves, Klein-Gordon equation, electron proper magnetic moment, CPT-symmetry, spin, and isotopic spin is consistent with the results of the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics.

It has been confirmed experimentally for photons, electrons, neutrons, atoms, for molecules having masses up to ten thousand amu, and also in collective states such as SQUIDs and Bose-Einstein condensates. However, the principle does not seem to hold for positions of large objects! Why for instance, a table is never found to be in two places at the same time? One possible explanation for the absence of macroscopic superpositions is that quantum theory is an approximation to a stochastic nonlinear theory. This hypothesis may have its fundamental origins in gravitational physics, and is being put to test by modern ongoing experiments on matter wave interferometry.\n\n==\n\nZych 2018:\n\nTitle: Relativity of quantum superpositions\n\nAbstract: In modern physics only relative quantities are considered to have physical significance. For example, position assigned to a system depends on the choice of coordinates, and only relative distances between different systems have physical relevance. On the other hand, in quantum theory the scenario where one system, A, is localised around certain position while another system B is in a spatial superposition is considered to be physically different from the scenario where A is in a superposition, while B is localised. Different physical effects are anticipated in the two scenarios especially when the two systems have widely different masses. Here we show that for any superposed amplitudes that are related by a symmetry transformation, the above scenarios are physically equivalent: probabilities for any measurement are the same whether we assign the superposition state to system A or to system B. More generally, linearity of quantum theory guarantees that if a theory is invariant under some symmetry transformations it is necessarily also invariant under their arbitrary `superpositions'. Thus the notion of a superposition turns out to be relative to the choice of coordinates, once it is realised that relations between coordinates do not need to be classical.", "final_summary": "The superposition principle and the linearity of motion, two seemingly contradictory concepts, have been the subject of extensive research in the realm of quantum physics.

At diagnosis all patients had pituitary macroadenomas, with wide extrasellar extension in 12. All patients underwent trans-sphenoidal surgery and immunohistochemical staining of surgically excised specimens showed the presence of gonadotroph and alpha-subunit cells in all pituitary adenomas. After surgery 3 patients had clear radiological evidence of normal pituitary; in the others a doubtful MRI picture or a residual adenomatous tissue were present. In the patients who did not undergo radiotherapy immediately after surgery, a regrowth of tumoral tissue was shown in 1-10 yrs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe stress the importance of a close follow-up of patients with gonadotroph adenomas after surgery, and we raise the question of whether radiotherapy may be useful for avoiding any further adenomatous regrowth.\n\n==\n\nYoung 1996:\n\nTitle: Gonadotroph adenoma of the pituitary gland: a clinicopathologic analysis of 100 cases.\n\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the clinical and pathologic features in a large cohort of randomly selected patients with gonadotroph pituitary adenomas.\n\n\nDESIGN\nWe retrospectively reviewed clinical, surgical, and pathologic findings in 100 patients (79 men and 21 women, 30 to 82 years old) with this tumor.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDiagnosis of a pituitary tumor was prompted by visual loss (43%), symptoms of hypopituitarism (22%), headache (8%), or a combination of these findings (10%); 17% of the patients were asymptomatic. Visual field defects were present in 68% of the study group, and complete or partial anterior pituitary failure was present in 77%. Serum prolactin concentrations were increased (maximum, 110 ng/mL) in 33% of patients. Hypersecretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) was documented in 11 and 5 patients, respectively. The serum level of alpha-subunit was increased in 1 of 29 patients in whom it was measured. All patients had pituitary macroadenomas, only 21% of which were grossly invasive. The surgical approach was transsphenoidal in all but two patients, who underwent transfrontal craniotomy; gross total tumor resection was achieved in 90%. By definition, all tumors had at least 10% immunoreactivity for LH, FSH, or both. All tumors were chromophobic. Ultrastructurally, the tumors were characterized as gonadotroph adenomas of \"male\" (45%) or \"female\" (9%) type as well as null-cell adenomas of the oncocytic (35%) or nononcocytic (11%) type. After a median follow-up of 4.3 years, 69% of the patients who had had visual field defects noted normalization or improvement. Persistent or clinically recurrent pituitary tumor tissue was present in 42%. A second pituitary surgical procedure was required in eight patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMost patients with clinically evident gonadotroph pituitary tumors have loss of vision and hypopituitarism. Hypersecretion of FSH or LH is unusual, and no distinct hormone-dependent clinical phenotype is present. Transsphenoidal surgical treatment generally yields normalization or improvement of visual field defects.\n\n==\n\nKwekkeboom 1992:\n\nTitle: Long-term treatment with the dopamine agonist CV 205-502 of patients with a clinically non-functioning, gonadotroph, or alpha-subunit secreting pituitary adenoma.\n\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nWe aimed to assess the effects of prolonged treatment with the dopamine agonist CV 205-502 on tumour volume, visual field defects, and serum gonadotrophin and alpha-subunit concentrations in patients with gonadotroph, alpha-subunit secreting, or clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe patients were treated with CV 205-502 in a final daily dose of 300 micrograms for at least 1 year. The patients were seen at 2 or 3-week intervals during the first 3 months of treatment, and thereafter every 1 or 2 months. Computerized tomography and Goldmann perimetry were performed before treatment and during follow-up. Blood samples were drawn before treatment and at each out-patient visit.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nOne patient with gonadotroph, two with alpha-subunit secreting, and two with clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas were studied.\n\n\nRESULTS\nComputerized tomography showed tumour shrinkage in one patient. In two other patients an improvement of visual field defects was observed. In four patients, a significant decrease in serum FSH and/or alpha-subunit concentrations occurred within the first 3 months of treatment. In the remaining patient, a significant decrease of serum FSH and alpha-subunit concentrations was found after more than 3 months of treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with clinically non-functioning, gonadotroph, or alpha-subunit secreting pituitary tumours, long-term treatment with the dopamine agonist CV 205-502 decreases serum FSH and/or alpha-subunit concentrations. This decreased secretory activity from the pituitary tumour may be accompanied by an improvement of visual field defects, or tumour shrinkage on computerized tomography. Therefore, treatment with CV 205-502 may be useful in patients with clinically non-functioning, gonadotroph, or alpha-subunit secreting pituitary tumours, who cannot be operated upon.\n\n==\n\nSnyder 1987:\n\nTitle: Gonadotroph cell pituitary adenomas.\n\nAbstract: The frequency of gonadotroph cell adenomas among all unselected pituitary adenomas is likely much higher than previously suspected. The prevalence in one series of 139 men with pituitary macroadenomas was 17 per cent (24 per cent if adenomas secreting only alpha subunit are included). The clinical characteristics of patients with gonadotroph cell adenomas are similar. Most are middle-aged men who have a history of normal pubertal development and a normal fertility history and by examination are normally virilized and have testes of normal size. They are brought to medical attention because of visual impairment, which is the result of the enormous size of the adenoma. The most common hormonal characteristics of gonadotroph cell adenomas in vivo is hypersecretion of FSH, which is often accompanied by hypersecretion of FSH-beta and alpha subunits and less often by hypersecretion of LH-beta or intact LH. Another common characteristic is secretion of FSH and/or LH-beta in response to TRH. A few patients with gonadotroph cell adenomas hypersecrete intact LH and therefore have supranormal serum testosterone concentrations. A larger number have secondary hypogonadism, because the adenomas are not secreting intact LH but are compressing the normal gonadotroph cells and impairing LH secretion. These patients have concentrations of intact LH that are not elevated, despite subnormal testosterone concentrations. The testosterone increases markedly in response to human chorionic gonadotropin. Both the clinical and hormonal characteristics of gonadotroph cell adenomas usually make them readily distinguishable from pituitary enlargement due to long-standing primary hypogonadism. Most gonadotroph cell adenomas are now managed first by transsphenoidal surgery to attempt to restore vision as quickly as possible, and then by supervoltage radiation to prevent regrowth of the remaining adenomatous tissue. Surgery usually does improve vision, as well as the pretreatment hormonal abnormalities, and radiation reduces FSH hypersecretion further. Dopamine agonist therapy is experimental but warrants further trial. The hormonal abnormalities detected prior to treatment, such as supranormal basal concentrations of FSH, alpha, and FSH-beta and the FSH and LH-beta responses to TRH, can be used to monitor the response to therapy.\n\n==\n\nSnyder 1985:\n\nTitle: Gonadotroph cell adenomas of the pituitary.\n\nAbstract: Although the frequency of gonadotroph cell adenomas among all unselected pituitary adenomas is not yet known, it is probably much higher than previously suspected. The true incidence is probably somewhere between the 3-4% found in surgical and autopsy series, which is probably an underestimate because of its reliance on tissue content, and the 17% (24% when alpha-secreting adenomas are included) of 139 patients from this institution, which may be an overestimate of the incidence among all adenomas, because it is heavily weighted to very large adenomas in men only. Most patients who have been reported to have gonadotroph cell adenomas have similar clinical characteristics. Most are middle-aged men who have a history of normal pubertal development and a normal fertility history, and by examination are normally virilized and have testes of normal size. They are brought to medical attention because of visual impairment, which is the result of the enormous size of the adenoma. The most common hormonal characteristic of gonadotroph cell adenomas in vivo is hypersecretion of FSH, which is often accompanied by hypersecretion of FSH beta and alpha-subunit and less often by hypersecretion of LH beta or intact LH. Another common characteristic is secretion of FSH and/or LH in response to TRH. A few patients with gonadotroph cell adenomas hypersecrete intact LH and, therefore, have supranormal serum testosterone concentrations. A larger number have secondary hypogonadism because the adenomas are not secreting intact LH, but are compressing the normal gonadotroph cells and impairing LH secretion. These patients have concentrations of intact LH that are not elevated in spite of subnormal testosterone concentrations. Testosterone levels increase markedly in response to hCG. The hormonal characteristics of gonadotroph adenomas in dispersed cell culture are similar to their characteristics in vivo, including hypersecretion of FSH and LH subunits and responsiveness to TRH. Both the clinical and hormonal characteristics of gonadotroph cell adenomas usually make them readily distinguishable from pituitary enlargement due to long-standing primary hypogonadism. Pituitary adenomas that hypersecrete only alpha-subunit in vivo may also be adenomas of gonadotroph cells, because some of them secrete large amounts of FSH as well as alpha-subunit in culture. Most gonadotroph cell adenomas are now treated first by transsphenoidal surgery, to attempt to restore vision as quickly as possible, and then by supervoltage radiation to prevent regrowth of the remaining adenomatous tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n\n==\n\nLanglois 2017:\n\nTitle: Clinical profile of silent growth hormone pituitary adenomas; higher recurrence rate compared to silent gonadotroph pituitary tumors, a large single center experience\n\nAbstract: PurposeStudy and comparison of characteristics of silent growth hormone adenomas (SGHA), silent corticotroph adenomas (SCA), and silent gonadotroph adenomas (SGA) in a single institution cohort of surgically treated pituitary adenomas.MethodsRetrospective analysis of SGHA surgically resected over 10 years: SGHA was defined as no clinical or biochemical evidence of acromegaly and positive GH immunostaining.ResultsOf 814 pituitary surgeries; 2.1% (n\u2009=\u200917) were SGHA, 4.5% (n\u2009=\u200937) SCA, and 18.9% (n\u2009=\u200970/371; 2011\u20132016) SGA. Mean age at SGHA diagnosis was 43 years, with a large female predominance (82%). Mean tumor size and cavernous/sphenoid sinus invasiveness for SGHA, SCA, and SGA were 1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0\u2009cm and 25%, 2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u2009cm and 43%, 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u2009cm and 41%, respectively (tumor size p\u2009=\u20090.009, SGHA vs. SGA, and invasion p; not-significant). During mean follow-up of 3.9 years, two patients (11%) developed elevated insulin-like growth factor-1 and five patients (29%) required a second surgery for tumor recurrence. Rate of surgical reintervention was similar to SCA (31%), but higher than SGA (10%) (p\u2009=\u20090.035, SGHA vs. SGA), and 18% underwent radiation therapy, similar to SCA (19%, p; not-significant) but higher than SGA (2.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.018).ConclusionThis is the largest single center study characterizing SGHA behavior with SGA and SCA control groups in a cohort of surgically resected pituitary adenomas. SGHA present mostly in young females, and should be closely followed due to their higher likelihood of recurrence and potential of progression to clinical acromegaly. We propose that a complete hormonal staining panel be routinely performed for all pituitary adenomas.\n\n==\n\nHo 1997:\n\nTitle: The clinicopathological characteristics of gonadotroph cell adenoma: a study of 118 cases.\n\nAbstract: Gonadotroph cell adenoma was the most common pituitary adenoma, constituting 35% of the pituitary adenomas in our series of 339 patients with surgically removed pituitary adenomas from June 1987 to December 1995. The average age of these patients was 53 years, with a male predominance (1.5:1). The most common neurological symptoms were visual symptoms and headache. Amenorrhea and galactorrhea were recorded in 41% and 14%, respectively, of the female patients of reproductive age. Oncocytic change of varying degrees was seen in 69% of the tumors, and the average age of these patients (56 years) was older than those who had no such change (47 years) (P < .005). Five types of gonadotroph cell adenomas were recognized; they were tumors that contained (1) betaFSH, betaLH, and alphaSU, (2) betaFSH and betaLH, (3) betaFSH and alphaSU, (4) betaFSH, and (5) alphaSU. The immunostaining of betaFSH-containing cells was usually diffuse, whereas staining of betaLH- or alphaSU-containing cells was usually focal. Double immunostaining showed the immunoreactive cells containing one or any combination of the gonadotropin subunits. Increases in serum gonadotropin levels were only seen in 35% of the patients with gonadotroph cell adenoma. There was no correlation between serum hormonal levels and immunostaining results. Of the 33 recurrent cases, significant decrease or total absence of immunoreactivity of one or more hormone subunits in subsequent biopsy specimens were seen in three cases.\n\n==\n\nGraillon 2019:\n\nTitle: Functioning gonadotroph adenoma with severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: A new emergency in pituitary adenoma surgery? Surgical considerations and literature review.\n\nAbstract: The authors reported 2\u00a0cases of functioning gonadotroph pituitary adenoma (FGPA) revealed by an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in young women. In the first case, OHSS was observed after GnRH analog injection. Pelvic echography revealed multiple voluminous ovarian cysts. Dopamine agonist posology failed in estradiol hypersecretion control, which necessitated endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery. The patient experienced improvement in pelvic pain as estradiol hypersecretion decreased during the first few postoperative days. Outcome was favorable, and her menstrual cycle was normal after two months. The second case was a young girl with spontaneous pelvic pain and elevated plasma FSH and estradiol levels. FGPA was confirmed on cerebral MRI. Dopamine agonists were introduced, and surgical removal of the pituitary tumor was scheduled for 7\u00a0days later. In the meantime, the patient was admitted and underwent surgery for bilateral adnexal torsion related to OHSS. The pituitary tumor was removed one week later. Outcome was favorable, and estradiol and FSH plasma levels were normal after 3\u00a0months. The ovarian cysts were no longer visible on echography after 3\u00a0months. Given the lack of efficacy of the current standard medical therapy, surgical removal of pituitary adenomas is the reference treatment for FGPA. The authors suggest that severe OHSS related to FGPA should be considered as a relative surgical emergency and that surgery should not be unduly delayed, given the unpredictable risk of adnexal torsion, particularly in case of voluminous ovarian cysts. The authors performed a literature review on this topic.", "final_summary": "The collective findings from the papers suggest that patients with gonadotroph pituitary adenomas require long-term follow-up due to the potential for tumor regrowth and recurrence. Manieri (2000) emphasizes the importance of close follow-up after surgery, noting that tumor regrowth can occur within 1-10 years post-surgery. Similarly, Young (1996) reports that persistent or clinically recurrent pituitary tumor tissue was present in 42% of patients, with some requiring a second surgical procedure. Snyder (1987) also highlights the need for monitoring the response to therapy using hormonal abnormalities detected prior to treatment. Langlois (2017) further supports the need for close follow-up, noting a higher likelihood of recurrence in silent growth hormone adenomas compared to silent gonadotroph pituitary tumors. In conclusion, the evidence suggests that patients with gonadotroph pituitary adenomas require long-term follow-up due to the potential for tumor regrowth and recurrence."}, {"query": "Policy Lessons and the Future of Unconventional Monetary Policy", "paper_list_string": "Duarte 2020:\n\nTitle: Unconventional Monetary Policies: Lessons from the Past and the Present to Future Monetary Policy Frameworks\n\nAbstract: This article intends to debate important aspects related to past and recent experiences of monetary policy accommodation, focusing on unconventional monetary policies.

Finally, we argue that central banks need to take advantage of past and recent experiences to improve the design of their future monetary policy frameworks under an evolutionary perspective. Based on this, measures previously implemented would have three possible destinations in new frameworks: i) Be discarded, due to their predominantly adverse effects; ii) Not be regularly implemented, but be kept as backstop mechanisms if needed; iii) Be incorporated as regular measures of monetary policy frameworks.\n\n==\n\nWilliams 2011:\n\nTitle: Unconventional monetary policy: lessons from the past three years\n\nAbstract: Presentation to the Swiss National Bank Research Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 23, 2011\n\n==\n\nWestelius 2020:\n\nTitle: Twenty Years of Unconventional Monetary Policies: Lessons and Way Forward for the Bank of Japan\n\nAbstract: The Bank of Japan has used unconventional monetary policies to fight deflation and stabilize the financial system since the late 1990s.

The federal funds rate had already been reduced to virtually zero. Thus, the Federal Reserve turned to unconventional monetary policies. Through \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d the Fed announced plans to buy mortgage-backed securities and debt issued by government-sponsored enterprises. Subsequent purchases would eventually lead to a five-fold expansion in the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, from $900 billion to $4.5 trillion, and leave the Fed holding over 20 percent of all mortgage-backed securities and marketable Treasury debt. In addition, Fed policy statements in December 2008 began to include explicit references to the likely path of the federal funds interest rate, a policy that came to be known as \u201cforward guidance.\u201d The Fed ceased its direct asset purchases in late 2014. Starting in October 2017, it has allowed the balance sheet to shrink gradually as existing assets mature. From December 2015 through June 2018, the Fed has raised the federal funds interest rate seven times. Thus, the time is ripe to step back and ask whether the Fed\u2019s unconventional policies had the intended expansionary effects\u2014and by extension, whether the Fed should use them in the future.\n\n==\n\nRossi 2019:\n\nTitle: Identifying and Estimating the Effects of Unconventional Monetary Policy: How to Do it and What Have We Learned?\n\nAbstract: How should one identify monetary policy shocks in unconventional times? Are unconventional monetary policies as effective as conventional ones? And has the transmission mechanism of monetary policy changed in the zerolower bound era? The recent Onancial crisis led Central banks to lower their interest rates in order to stimulate the economy, and interest rates in many advanced economies hit the zero lower bound. As a consequence, the traditional approach to the identification and the estimation of monetary policy faces new econometric challenges in unconventional times. This article aims at providing a broad overview of the recent literature on the identification of unconventional monetary policy shocks and the estimation of their effects on both financial as well as macroeconomic variables. Given that the prospects of slow recoveries and long periods of very low interest rates are becoming the norm, many economists believe that we are likely to face unconventional monetary policy measures often in the future. Hence, these are potentially very important issues in practice.\n\n==\n\nCecioni 2011:\n\nTitle: Unconventional Monetary Policy in Theory and in Practice\n\nAbstract: In this chapter, after discussing the theoretical underpinnings of unconventional monetary policy measures, we review the existing empirical evidence on their effectiveness, focusing on those adopted by central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve. These measures operate in two ways \u2014 through the signaling channel and through the portfolio balance channel. In the former, the central bank uses communication to steer interest rates and to restore confidence in the financial markets; the latter hinges on the imperfect substitutability of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet of the private sector and postulates that the central bank\u2019s asset purchases and liquidity provision lower financial yields and improve funding conditions in some markets. Our review of the empirical literature suggests that the unconventional measures were effective and that their impact on the economy was sizeable. However, a large degree of uncertainty surrounds the precise quantification of these effects.", "final_summary": "Unconventional monetary policies (UMPs) have been a hot topic in the world of economics, particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. These policies, which include measures such as quantitative easing, forward guidance, and negative interest rates, have been implemented by central banks worldwide to stimulate economies and stabilize financial systems (Duarte, 2020; Westelius, 2020; Borio, 2016).\n\nThe effectiveness of UMPs is a subject of debate. Duarte (2020) suggests that central banks should learn from past experiences to improve future monetary policy frameworks. Similarly, Westelius (2020) proposes strengthening the Bank of Japan's policy framework by focusing on objectives, strategies, and communication, and coordinating monetary, fiscal, and financial policies. \n\nHowever, the effectiveness of UMPs is not universally agreed upon. Borio (2016) argues that while UMPs have influenced financial conditions, their impact on output and inflation is less clear, and their cost-benefit balance may deteriorate over time. Kuttner (2018) also questions the expansionary effects of the Federal Reserve's UMPs during the Great Recession and whether they should be used in the future.\n\nThe future of UMPs is uncertain. Rossi (2019) suggests that unconventional monetary policy measures may become more common due to slow recoveries and long periods of very low interest rates. Cecioni (2011) concludes that UMPs have been effective and had a sizeable impact on the economy, but acknowledges that there is a large degree of uncertainty surrounding these effects.\n\nIn conclusion, while UMPs have been widely used and have had some success in influencing financial conditions, their long-term effectiveness and future role in monetary policy frameworks remain subjects of debate (Duarte, 2020; Westelius, 2020; Borio, 2016; Kuttner, 2018; Rossi, 2019; Cecioni, 2011)."}, {"query": "PROJECT TEAM BUILDING FRAMEWORK", "paper_list_string": "Gronau 2007:\n\nTitle: Approach for requirement oriented team building in industrial processes\n\nAbstract: This contribution presents an approach for requirement oriented team building in industrial processes like product development.

The process of forming a project team is an important detail of prelaunch preparation and an essential area of work during the project implementation period. Within the framework of this process, the priority area is the optimization of the activities of HR-management when solving the problem of combining specialists with various skills, values, ideas and the distribution of their roles and responsibilities. The urgency of the problem of improving the decision-making process in the HR management system in the context of digital transformation through the development of new models of activity, combining the capabilities of technology and traditional management in the face of the emergence of new information products and processes with fundamentally different qualities determined the direction and structure of the study. The aim of the study is to analyze the functional capabilities of digital technologies used in personnel management, to substantiate the need for the use of HR-management automated systems and decision-making support methods, as well as to develop a methodological approach to the implementation of the initial stage of team formation procedure. In the course of the research, the method of analysis of expert data, procedures of multi-criteria selection, the analytic hierarchy process, optimization models were used. The proposed approach involves a complex combination of a formalized algorithm for expert evaluation and of an optimization problem, namely, a sequential solution of the problem of optimal selection of candidates and the problem of distribution of candidates who have passed the rating selection. It is concluded that the developed methodology for the formation of project teams significantly expands the capabilities of HR analytics and contributes to a more efficient distribution of candidates for project vacancies, but at the same time acts only as a tool that helps an expert.\n\n==\n\nSilveira 2021:\n\nTitle: Successful Practices in ICT Team Building in International Projects\n\nAbstract: The purpose of the chapter is to address the importance of building the project team in order to contribute to maximize the number of project success histories in an international context.

The need to define strategies when setting up the teams is emphasized, so that specialists are incorporated in the various domains, taking into account the specificity of the country in which the project will take place.

The main result of this work is a requirement\n set for team building, of simple understanding and easy\n application, which might contribute to reduce certain failures in\n software project related to team working.\n\n==\n\nHlaoittinun 2008:\n\nTitle: A multidisciplinary team building method based on competency modelling in design project management\n\nAbstract: Abstract This research aims to develop a new team building method based on competency modelling in the field of project management. This method is divided into three main stages. First, a competency matrix based on a task-actor compatibility indicator helps to characterise the competency levels. Second, we apply a clustering algorithm in order to reduce the problem complexity and favour the employees\u2019 expertise. The clustering algorithm will decompose large sets of tasks and actors into smaller task groups related to different actor groups. It facilitates the project leaders to organise the actors into teams. Finally, the proposed task assignment model incorporates a learning curve in order to take the competency dynamics into account. Our computational experiments suggest that incorporating a clustering algorithm as a step of the method results in preserving expertise and thus helps project managers to find better tradeoffs between project cost (short term goal) and competency dynamics (long term goal).\n\n==\n\nThamhain 1987:\n\nTitle: Building high performing engineering project teams\n\nAbstract: This article summarizes four years of research into the drivers and barriers of effective teambuilding in engineering work environments. A simple input-output model is presented for organizing and analyzing the various factors which influence team performance. The field survey results supported by correlation analysis indicate that team performance is primarily associated with six driving forces and six barriers which are related to: leadership, job content, personal needs, and general work environment. Specific recommendations are made.", "final_summary": "Project team building is a multifaceted process that requires careful consideration of various factors to ensure success. Gronau (2007) emphasizes the importance of requirement-oriented team building in industrial processes, suggesting that knowledge modeling can guide team composition decisions. Similarly, Bulgakova (2022) underscores the significance of optimizing HR-management activities during team formation, advocating for the use of digital technologies and decision-making support methods in the process.\n\nSilveira (2021) highlights the importance of team building in international projects, suggesting that the incorporation of specialists from various domains, considering the cultural, legal, and fiscal frameworks of the project's location, can contribute to project success. Gharaibeh (2019) echoes this sentiment, focusing on the construction industry and identifying communication, trust, and leadership as key dimensions of project team building.\n\nFran\u00e7a (2008) also acknowledges the significant role of team building in software project success, suggesting that considering personal aspects in team formation and enhancing the technical preparation of project managers can contribute to project success. Hlaoittinun (2008) proposes a competency-based team building method, which includes a competency matrix, clustering algorithm, and task assignment model to optimize team performance.\n\nThamhain (1987) presents an input-output model to analyze factors influencing team performance, identifying leadership, job content, personal needs, and the general work environment as key drivers and barriers.\n\nIn conclusion, these studies collectively suggest that successful project team building requires a comprehensive approach that considers individual competencies, cultural and contextual factors, communication, trust, leadership, and the use of digital technologies and decision-making support methods.

In reality the importance of the book is far from this. Although the evil and tragedy resulting from one medical experiment are its theme, a critical and fair reading finds a more balanced view that includes science\u2019s potential to improve the human condition and reasons why such an experiment went awry. The author argues that Frankenstein is an early and balanced text on the ethics of research upon human subjects and that it provides insights that are as valid today as when the novel was written. As a narrative it provides a gripping story that merits careful analysis by those involved in medical research and its ethical review, and it is more enjoyable than many current textbooks! To support this thesis, the author will place the book in historical, scientific context, analyse it for lessons relevant to those involved in research ethics today, and then draw conclusions.\n\n==\n\nBissonette 2010:\n\nTitle: Teaching the Monster: Frankenstein and Critical Thinking\n\nAbstract: Student readers often switch, with a taste for the unambiguous, from presuming Mary Shelley's monster to be wholly bad, to exonerating him completely, and sometimes swinging back to \"evil.\" Both sympathy and condemnation\u2014the \"whose fault is it\" debate\u2014curtail the kind of critical thinking and application that is the goal of most of the courses in which Frankenstein is taught. The students' imagination of the heart and the professor's conceptual framework, sympathy and analysis, run parallel to and often counteract or resist each other. This essay proposes the importance of emphasizing the monster himself, returning to the monster as a monster, refusing to allow him to melt into a symbol in the classroom; it further suggests a practice of \"teaching the monster\" as a pedagogy of alienation that can be applied beyond Frankenstein.\n\n==\n\nOzherelyev 2020:\n\nTitle: Philosophical contexts in Mary Shelley\u2019s novel \u00abFrankenstein\u00bb\n\nAbstract: The paper analyzes the key philosophical contexts and subtexts of M. Shelley\u2019s most famous work \u201cFrankenstein\u201d. According to the author of the article, the philosophical layer of this Gothic novel consists of ideas and maxims that directly inherit the concepts of the worldview platforms of Plato, J.-J. Russo, G. W. F. Hegel, K. F. Volney, W. Godwin, M. Wollstonecraft, as well as the philosophy of the New Age and romanticism. An assumption is made, on the one hand, about the proximity of some worldview attitudes of these philosophers and the author of \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and, on the other hand, about the deliberate introduction of philosophical passages into the fabric of the novel, which play the role of retardation elements.\n\n==\n\nDebnath 2019:\n\nTitle: Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein As A Text About Nature and Culture\n\nAbstract: In Mary Shelley\u2019s novel Frankenstein (1818), we find several dichotomies: culture/nature, self/other, ego/id, male/female et cetera. In the novel, Victor is a scientist who wants to inject life into inanimate objects and thereby become a creator, a god. As science is an element of culture, Victor is associated with culture. But he represents the darker side of culture: scientism misused as fantasy. On the other hand, the creature is associated with nature. Though Victor infuses life into the monster through a scientific experiment, the monster is still a nature\u2019s child as he is brought up in the midst of wild natural landscape. In the novel, we find that \u2018male\u2019 science (as a part of culture), in the person of Victor, penetrates \u201cinto the recesses of nature\u201d (Shelley, 1818).\n\n==\n\nGinn 2013:\n\nTitle: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein: exploring neuroscience, nature, and nurture in the novel and the films.\n\nAbstract: The story of Victor Frankenstein's quest to conquer death produced a legacy that has endured for almost 200 years. Powerful in its condemnation of the scientist's quest to achieve knowledge at any cost, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is one of the most enduring novels of all time. It has never been out of print and has been translated to both stage and screen many times since its \"birth.\" Numerous novels, short stories, and scripts have drawn upon Shelley's primary theme: the creation of a living organism from the dead, dying, and decaying body parts of human beings. Although Mary does not provide details of the animation process, particularly in her first edition, the process has been explored with a great deal of imagination and originality in the various cinematic portrayals of the story. Equally important as the theme of the scientist's quest for knowledge is the role that a creator plays in the life of its creation. Mary Shelley's novel pondered on how rejection would affect the offspring of such \"unnatural\" origins. In keeping with the \"scientific\" basis of the Creature's birth, cinematic portrayals attempted to provide a scientific rationale for the Creature's descent into madness and its evil behavior. From Robert Florey's initial script for the 1931 film directed by James Whale to the more recent films and television series, an abnormal brain is considered to be the cause of the madness and malignity of the Creature.\n\n==\n\nHoeveler 2003:\n\nTitle: Frankenstein , feminism, and literary theory\n\nAbstract: Cave ab homine unius libri , as the Latin epigram warns us: \u201cbeware the author of one book.\u201d Frankenstein has so overshadowed Mary Shelley's other books in the popular imagination that many readers believe - erroneously - that she is a one-book author. While this is decidedly not the case, Frankenstein has figured more importantly in the development of feminist literary theory than perhaps any other novel, with the possible exception of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre . This essay will discuss the major feminist literary interpretations of the novel, beginning with Ellen Moers's landmark reading in Literary Women and then move to the more recent approaches taken by critics engaged in post-colonial theory, cultural studies, queer theory, and disability studies. In the process we will explore the provocative claim made by Fred Botting, who noted, \u201c Frankenstein is a product of criticism, not a work of literature.\u201d Let us begin by describing briefly the three major strands in feminist literary criticism: American, French, and British. American feminist literary critics (represented best perhaps by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar) understand \u201cwomen\u2019s experiences\u201d to be the basis of the differences in women\u2019s writings. American feminist critics of the 1970s and 1980s tended to discuss recurring patterns of themes (i.e., the valorization of the quotidian value of domestic life, human community and relationships) or imagery (i.e., houses, claustrophobia, food and eating disorders, insanity, fetishizing of clothing, body image, etc.) in works by women. Led by the pioneering work of Elaine Showalter, such critics also took pains to rediscover \u201clost\u201d women writers and to demonstrate the continuities of a women\u2019s literary tradition.\n\n==\n\nHatch 2008:\n\nTitle: Disruptive affects: shame, disgust, and sympathy in Frankenstein\n\nAbstract: Many critical approaches to Frankenstein have relied on an ethical reading of the Creature\u2019s predicament \u2013 that he is benevolent within and ugly without. The emotional responses to the Creature\u2019s condition that the novel evokes are illuminated when cast in psychoanalytical light. This article traces how shame and disgust, as theorized by Silvan Tomkins, operate in the novel, and how these responses disrupt or undermine the function of sympathy, as described by Adam Smith. In doing so, the article attempts to show that ethical readings of the novel \u2013 readings which participate in both Enlightenment ideas of sympathy and Romantic ideas of the \u201cOther\u201d \u2013 remain problematic because of the enduring presence of shame and disgust throughout the novel. The novel remains as powerful as it is partly because of the irreconcilability of the affects of shame and disgust with the ethical operation of sympathy.\n\n==\n\nRauch 1995:\n\nTitle: The Monstrous Body of Knowledge in Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\"\n\nAbstract: i.

Murray, 1803). 2. The literature on Frankenstein is extensive. Several studies are worth noting here to give a sense of the breadth of the work that has been done. Ann Mellor has contributed significandy to feminist readings of the novel; her study is strongly grounded in textual analysis as well as close attention to contemporary events in science. Ellen Moers's early essay is a cornerstone of feminist thinking with respect to the novel. See also Mary Poovey's The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1984) and Margaret Homans' Bearing the Word (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1986) for analyses of Shelley and of the novel.

This ethical dimension, intertwined with scientific exploration, may pose a challenge for students to fully grasp.\n\nBissonette (2010) discusses the difficulty students face in understanding the character of the monster, oscillating between viewing him as wholly evil or completely innocent. The author emphasizes the importance of viewing the monster as a complex character, not merely a symbol, which can be a challenging task for students.\n\nOzherelyev (2020) delves into the philosophical contexts of the novel, tracing its roots to the ideas of Plato, Rousseau, Hegel, and others. The integration of these philosophical concepts into the narrative can be difficult for students to identify and understand.\n\nDebnath (2019) explores the dichotomies present in the novel, such as culture/nature and self/other. While the abstract does not explicitly state that these dichotomies can be challenging for students to interpret and visualize, it can be inferred from the complexity of these themes.\n\nGinn (2013) discusses the neuroscience aspects of the novel, focusing on the creation of the monster from dead body parts and the role of a creator in the life of its creation. The scientific rationale for the monster's behavior can be a challenging concept for literature students.\n\nHoeveler (2003) discusses the feminist literary interpretations of the novel. While the abstract does not explicitly state that these interpretations can be difficult for students to understand and apply, the complexity of feminist literary theory suggests potential challenges.\n\nHatch (2008) explores the emotional responses evoked by the novel, focusing on shame, disgust, and sympathy. Understanding these emotional responses and their impact on the reader can be a challenging task for students.\n\nFinally, Rauch (1995) is mentioned in the summary, but the abstract does not provide enough information to make a specific claim about the representation of knowledge in the novel or the difficulty for students to comprehend and visualize it.\n\nIn conclusion, the papers collectively suggest that the themes and ideas in \"Frankenstein\" are complex and multifaceted, encompassing ethical, philosophical, scientific, feminist, and emotional dimensions. These complexities can pose significant challenges for students pursuing an M.A. in English Literature in understanding and visualizing the novel."}, {"query": "What is the relationship between music and task performance+", "paper_list_string": "Chen 2022:\n\nTitle: The Effect of Background Music on Young People (10-24)\u2019 Task Performance\n\nAbstract: Current studies on the effects of background music are controversial and lack consensus.

Results indicate that those in the Classical music condition performed better on the problem solving-task than those in the Punk music or No Music conditions. However, those listening to the Classical music offered more off-task comments during the task than those listening to No Music.

Task characteristics may be accounting for these inconclusive findings. Thus, this study employs effort to mediate music\u2019s effect on task performance (objective and perceived) under a stressful decision-making process. This is a between-group experiment with three conditions: slow-tempo music, fast-tempo music, or no music. We designed a computer web interface, where participants did a stressful task. Results demonstrated that participants made a strong effort under the conditions with music. Hence, turning the music off under stressful activities is favorable in terms of performance.

Two complementary studies are presented that replicate and explore previous findings. One study of college students showed that listening to a Mozart sonata induces subsequent short-term spatial reasoning facilitation and tested the effects of highly repetitive music on spatial reasoning. The second study extends the findings of a preliminary pilot study of 1993 which suggested that music training of three-year-olds provides long-term enhancements of nonverbal cognitive abilities already present at significant leveli in infants.

Task performance and associated physiological changes were studied in participants who listened to music (Indian classical instrument or Indo jazz). Their mood and their perceived emotions were evaluated using positive and negative affect schedule and self assessment manikin scales, and their pulse rate was measured. Visual Go and No-go trials were given as task stimuli and task performance was measured. Changes in the mean pulse rate were significantly low (P < 0.05) during Indo jazz. We conclude that Indian classical instrument and Indo jazz induced positive effects and enhanced task performance.\n\n==\n\nHallam 2002:\n\nTitle: The Effects of Background Music on Primary School Pupils' Task Performance\n\nAbstract: Research on the effects of background music has a long history. Early work was not embedded within a theoretical framework, was often poorly conceptualised and produced equivocal findings. This paper reports two studies exploring the effects of music, perceived to be calming and relaxing, on performance in arithmetic and on a memory task in children aged 10-12. The calming music led to better performance on both tasks when compared with a no-music condition. Music perceived as arousing, aggressive and unpleasant disrupted performance on the memory task and led to a lower level of reported altruistic behaviour by the children. This suggests that the effects of music on task performance are mediated by arousal and mood rather than affecting cognition directly. The findings are discussed in relation to possible practical applications in the primary school and the home.\n\n==\n\nWolfe 1983:\n\nTitle: Effects of Music Loudness on Task Performance and Self-Report of College-Aged Students\n\nAbstract: This study examined the effects of the loudness of background music on task performance of college students. In addition, students' perceptions of the music and the effect these perceptions had on performance were investigated. Two hundred undergraduate nonmusic majors were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups: (1) task only (no music); (2) task plus background music presented at 60\u201370 dB (all decibel measurements here are on the C scale); (3) task plus background music presented at 70\u201380 dB; and (4) task plus background music presented at 80\u201390 dB. The performance task consisted of computing mathematic problems, and a questionnaire was subsequently administered to the task plus background music groups to assess perceptions of the background environment. Results indicated that (1) the experimental conditions had no significant effect on task performance; (2) the majority of subjects did recognize the music and were able to identify some of the selections; and (3) subjects in the 80\u201390 dB group perceived the music as most distracting, with the majority of these same subjects reporting that the musical element of loudness seemed to be the contributing factor. Findings are discussed in relation to current music and noise research, and implications for educational and therapeutic applications are given.\n\n==\n\nDalton 2008:\n\nTitle: Effects of noise and music on human and task performance: A systematic review\n\nAbstract: The purpose of the present paper was to review the literature to develop an understanding of the effects of noise and music on human performance. The second purpose was to study the effects of music on a commonly performed task that is frequently accompanied by background music: driving. Background noise not only affects public health, but it also negatively affects human performance in such tasks as comprehension, attention, and vigilance. However, some studies have indicated that noise exposure may not affect simple vigilance. Despite music's distinct difference from noise it too affects human performance negatively and positively. The results are inconclusive on the effects of music and task performance. More specifically, the effects of music on driving performance are quite similar to that of noise on task performance. Music seems to alleviate driver stress and mild aggression while at times facilitating performance. However, during other conditions of music, driving performance is impaired. Different aspects of sound (i.e. volume, type, tempo) impact human performance differently. It is still unknown which aspect (music or noise) affects task performance to a greater degree.", "final_summary": "The relationship between music and task performance is a fascinating area of study, with research revealing a complex interplay between these two elements. \n\nChen (2022) found that older students were better suited to playing background music while studying, and that fast-major music without lyrics can have the best positive impact on task performance.

This article examines some cross cutting issues in PHC and outlines strategies to enhance the utilization of health services by rural people. The responsibility for perpetuating the existing low use of PHC services should be held by PHC policy makers and LGA. Responsible health personnel can build a new social order, based on greater equity and human dignity, in which health for all by the year 2015, including that of rural populations, will no more be a dream but a reality.

The Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) develops policies and physical structures, and supervises the operations of the healthcare system. The Primary Health Care (PHC) level has been identified as the appropriate setting to tackle 90 - 95% of major causes of morbidity and mortality because of its proximity to over 80% of the populace. At the PHC level, the services provided include integrated preventive, promotive and community development activities. However, the implementation of PHC in Nigeria has lacked impact and sustainability, thus leading to the research discussed in this paper which is aimed at proposing an innovative procurement system for sustaining PHC facilities in Nigeria. The proposed system is focused at developing and encouraging a new market for investment in primary care and community-based facilities and services. It is a form of Public\u00ad-Private Partnership (PPP) that enjoys national support but with local control. One of the central objectives is the idea of bringing together all the various local stakeholders, interests and users that comprise the local health economy. The arrangement is expected to offer considerable social and economic benefits while satisfying the fundamental philosophy of PHC.\n\n==\n\nIbeneme 2020:\n\nTitle: Strengthening capacities among digital health leaders for the development and implementation of national digital health programs in Nigeria\n\nAbstract: Discussions on the use of digital health to advance health have continued to gain traction over the past decades. This is important considering the rising penetration of mobile phones and other digital technologies and the opportunity to leverage those digital and electronic health methods and innovations to accelerate Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and the health Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In Nigeria, however, the full benefits of digital technologies to strengthen the health systems are yet to be fully harnessed due to critical challenges in the sector. These challenges include but not limited to weak health systems governance, weak infrastructural investments, inadequate resources, weak human resource capacity, high cost of scaling-up and coordination issues among others. Lack of systems thinking, and design have significant impact on coordination of efforts and has resulted in the fragmentation and non-interoperability among various applications. To discuss these challenges and propose the way forward for rapid sustainable, scalable and cost-effective deployment of digital health in Nigeria, a digital health capacity development workshop was held in Abuja and across the six geo-political zones of Nigeria from 20th \u2013 30th November 2019. This paper documents key conclusions and achievements at the workshop. The workshop was organized around eleven modules and seven thematic areas which explored the Nigerian digital health governance and coordinating mechanisms in view of its status, leadership, financing and deployment for effective service delivery. It was attended by over 100 participants from varied background including Ministries of Health, Ministries of Communications and Digital Economy, International Organizations, Operators, Civil Society, Academia and Private Sector Experts. The workshop resolved that while digital health technologies offer profound opportunities to strengthen Nigerian health systems for UHC and the health SDGs, there should be a move from donor-driven pilot projects to robust, sustainable, cost-effective and nationally owned projects. This will involve a people-centered approach that should be demand-driven and not supply-driven to avoid wasting time on ineffective interventions, duplication of efforts and wastage of scarce health resources. Government ownership and leadership was identified as critical for sustainable financing and effective scale up of Digital Health projects in Nigeria. The DH capacity development workshop was a good forum to deliberate important issues regarding sustainable and cost-effective DH solutions that could be scaled to strengthen health service delivery in Nigeria. Insightful ideas for scaling DH in Nigeria and other related settings emanated from the workshop, necessitating the need for a focused government commitment and leadership in institutionalizing digital health in Nigeria.\n\n==\n\nFronczak 2015:\n\nTitle: Dual indices for prioritizing investment in decentralized HIV services at Nigerian primary health care facilities\n\nAbstract: Decentralizing health services, including those for HIV prevention and treatment, is one strategy for maximizing the use of limited resources and expanding treatment options; yet few methods exist for systematically identifying where investments for service expansion might be most effective, in terms of meeting needs and rapid availability of improved services. The Nigerian Government, the United States Government under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program and other donors are expanding services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV to primary health care facilities in Nigeria. Nigerian primary care facilities vary greatly in their readiness to deliver HIV/AIDS services. In 2012, MEASURE Evaluation assessed 268 PEPFAR-supported primary health care facilities in Nigeria and developed a systematic method for prioritizing these facilities for expansion of PMTCT services. Each assessed facility was scored based on two indices with multiple, weighted variables: one measured facility readiness to provide PMTCT services, the other measured local need for the services and feasibility of expansion. These two scores were compiled and the summary score used as the basis for prioritizing facilities for PMTCT service expansion. The rationale was that using need and readiness to identify where to expand PMTCT services would result in more efficient allocation of resources. A review of the results showed that the indices achieved the desired effect\u2014that is prioritizing facilities with high need even when readiness was problematic and also prioritizing facilities where rapid scale-up was feasible. This article describes the development of the two-part index and discusses advantages of using this approach when planning service expansion. The authors' objective is to contribute to development of methodologies for prioritizing investments in HIV, as well as other public health arenas, that should improve cost-effectiveness and strengthen services and systems in resource-limited countries.\n\n==\n\nAbosede 2014:\n\nTitle: Strengthening the Foundation for Sustainable Primary Health Care Services in Nigeria\n\nAbstract: Since 1978\u2019s Alma-Ata Declaration on Primary Health Care (PHC) with the popular slogan \u201cHealth for All by the Year 2000\u201d and subsequently the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of the Year 2000, Nigeria has made 3 major attempts to establish a sustainable PHC system and some of the reasons for failure of the first two have been identified.

In response to the global imperative of Education for All, and not willing to be left at lower side of \u2018digital divide\u2019 Nigeria launched Universal Basic Education in 1999 and developed an ICT policy in 2001. One of the objectives of the policy focused on integrating ICT into the mainstream of education and training, including basic education. This has been evolving through a number of private and donor-funded initiatives though there is the need to ensure effective and sustained use of ICT in mainstream formal education system. This study explores Nigeria\u2019s ICT in education policies, implementation efforts, and availability of ICT tools in schools; teachers\u2019 knowledge, experience and practices in use of ICT at the basic education level; using qualitative analysis of existing documents and descriptive research design. The survey instrument is a self-designed and validated 50-item questionnaire administered to sampled basic education teachers in Lagos state. Findings showed that Nigeria is yet to fully commit to ICT integration in education as two key ingredients are lacking- skilled teachers and ICT tools and other infrastructures.

Their resultant focus on activities performed on the job works well in this environment where the ability to perform the activity adequately is objectively verifiable by testing and observation. Although many organizations have adapted these techniques for salaried employees and service environments, the focus on activities performed has never been satisfactory. For example, stating that a project manager `prepares regular project status reports' tells us little about what to look for in a potential project manager or how to determine if a practicing project manager is ready for additional responsibilities. The concept of a `competency model' has been developed within the last decade to address this shortcoming. Competency models focus on what skills are needed to perform the tasks defined by the job description. For example, a project manager must be able to communicate well both orally and in writing in order to `prepare regular project status reports.'\n\n==\n\nBerg 2007:\n\nTitle: Mental Models in Project Management Coaching\n\nAbstract: Abstract: Project managers have always been given the highest priority to customer needs and demands; however, tougher market competition has created a stronger focus on knowledge, skills, and capability to lead a project team toward success. Traditionally, managers have emphasized knowledge and skills within technical disciplines as a key factor managing projects. Today we see a shift toward more emphasis on organizational and human aspects of project work. An effective tool for meeting this challenge is project management coaching. This article focuses on what coaching is about, when to use coaching, different types of coaching, the coaching process, and coaching roles.

Previous research has identified four skills of effective project managers, namely, conceptual, human, political, and technical skills, along with their 16 skill components. The aim of this paper is to determine skill components that influence time, cost, and quality performance in construction projects. Data were collected from 107 project managers using a questionnaire survey method. The analysis results show that interpersonal influence has positive relationship with project time performance. Project cost performance is influenced by four skill components, namely, emotional intelligence, interpersonal skill, apparent sincerity, and budgeting. Lastly, project quality performance is affected by eight skill components, which include visioning, emotional intelligence, interpersonal skill, transformational leadership, interpersonal influence, apparent sincerity, quality management, and document and contract administration. Construction organisations may use the finding as a guideline to appoint project managers with the 'right' skill profile or to focus their human resource development on skills that are important for project success.\n\n==\n\nHanna 2018:\n\nTitle: A data-driven approach for identifying project manager competency weights\n\nAbstract: Competent project managers (PMs) are the backbone of any construction project. It is extremely important to constantly develop and enhance their competencies. However, to establish effective training and development plans for PMs, the relative importance of the key competencies that define a PM\u2019s performance should be first understood. Instead of subjectively weighting the relative importance of differing competencies, this paper aims at developing an automated model that uses real-life data to compute the PM competency weights. The rationale behind the model is to maximize the distance in a higher dimensional space between average and exceptional PM performances. The model solves an eigenvalue problem, and identifies a single data-based weight for each competency. The model is generic and can be applied to various research settings to alleviate the problems associated with opinion-based assessment and reduce individuals\u2019 subjectivity.

This study addressed this gap by asking 19 practicing IT PMs to describe the skills that successful IT PMs exhibit. A semi\u2010structured interview method known as the repertory grid (RepGrid) technique was used to elicit these skills. Nine skill categories emerged: client management, communication, general management, leadership, personal integrity, planning and control, problem solving, systems development and team development. Our study complements existing research by providing a richer understanding of several skills that were narrowly defined (client management, planning and control, and problem solving) and by introducing two new skill categories that had not been previously discussed (personal integrity and team development). Analysis of the individual RepGrids revealed four distinct ways in which study participants combined skill categories to form archetypes of effective IT PMs. We describe these four IT PM archetypes \u2013 General Manager, Problem Solver, Client Representative and Balanced Manager \u2013 and discuss how this knowledge can be useful for practitioners, researchers and educators.

UAE is the eighth largest oil producer in the world which is the main source used for development. UAE is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC) council. UAE is one of the world\u2019s most open and successful economies. UAE maintains a free-market economy and is one of the most politically stable and secure in the region. All together ensures that UAE has a robust competitive edge since it is the region\u2019s premier commercial hub and the second largest economy. In addition, this economic environment encourages the establishment of private universities and branches of well-known foreign universities in UAE. In this study, the impact of education on the sustainable economic development is measured by human development index (HDI) using simultaneous equations approach of two equations. The results show that there are more than one million students enrolled in primary and secondary schools and more than 60 thousand enrolled in territory education in more than 561 programs distributed over 70 institutions, around 40% of them are noncitizens.

Using a literature review, three elements were examined: its development and structure, quality, and research capacity. The findings reveal that the UAE\u2019s higher education sector has witnessed remarkable growth since 1997, guided by the state\u2019s policy commitment, and few restrictions on foreign universities opening branches in the UAE. This situation has led to substantial growth in the supply of higher education opportunities for the Emirati and expatriate population. Despite the UAE having achieved a high ranking for \u2018quality indicators\u2019 on the global level in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Competitiveness Reports, the quality of graduates, education, and research engagement is still debatable. Significant efforts are needed to ensure that these critical issues, as well as the understudied expansion of higher education institutions, are being addressed to erase the misalignment with the UAE\u2019s strategic goals.\n\n==\n\nSpranza 2016:\n\nTitle: Globalization of Higher Education in United Arab Emirates\n\nAbstract: This article explores the educational history of the United Arab Emirates, a young and vastly wealthy nation located in the Middle East. A nation for just over 40 years, its leaders have struggled with educating and supporting its native population and managing the massive infusion of immigrants created by the progressive job markets established within its borders. With a mix of mandated free education for natives and a lucrative educational investment market from various other nations, the educational structure in the UAE has become a unique system that attracts students and faculty from around the world. The opulent landscapes of the primary cities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi create a truly global educational environment poised to help lead the region into the future. As a country, the UAE population is highly concentrated in its two major cities of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, with 70 percent of the total population living in these locations. The oil industry boom in the late 1970\u2019s drew a large number of immigrant workers (initially primarily from India and Pakistan) and the trend of attracting droves of migrant workers has continued throughout the last 40 years. Today, approximately 88 percent of the total UAE population are expatriates drawn to the country for the labor market, leaving only 12 percent of the population as native Arabs (NQA, 2013). Currently, almost 65 percent of the national population is under the age of 24 so the country\u2019s growth in its native peoples is on the upswing. This presents the opportunity to cultivate a strong educated national workforce that could help balance the UAE\u2019s reliance on expatriates in the labor market. Education has been a priority for the UAE government since the country\u2019s inception in 1971 and the leaders have invested highly in the development and promotion of all levels of education, from nursery schools to doctoral level programs. However, the UAE government had a steep sand dune to climb since the national literacy rates in 1975 were 54 percent for men and only 31 percent for women. The UAE constitution and Federal Law No. 11 of 1972 established compulsory primary education and guaranteed free education at all levels for all UAE nationals. However, secondary education through grade 12 or age 18 was not made compulsory until 2012. The end result of the concentration on education for its citizens was shown in a 2010 report that indicated the national literacy rates were 89 percent for men and 91 percent for women (UNESCO, 2012). The government-sponsored higher education system was started in 1975 when the young nation opened the UAE University in the city of Al Ain near the border with Oman. UAEU now has six campuses across the country. The largest national institution, the Higher Colleges of Technology, was founded in 1988 and now has 17 campuses across the country. The third and newest national institution, Zayed University, was founded in 1998 and has two campus locations. The Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MHESR) governs and sets policy for all institutions of higher education across the country, but several Emirates also have governing bodies that regulate the education sector in their own territory. When the MHESR was created, it was established on four policy decisions that would guide its efforts. These decisions included: 1. The UAE would build and operate its own universities; 2. Qualified faculty that 17 Spranza: Globalization of Higher Education in United Arab Emirates Published by Digital Commons@Georgia Southern, 2016 meet international standards would be employed; 3. Instruction would be predominantly in English; and 4. Education was to be free for all qualified Emiratis, and would include women (MHESR, 2007). The Ministry also includes the Commission of Academic Accreditation (CAA) which certifies all institutions of higher education much like the SACS organization does here in the southern part of the United States. According to the CAA, there are currently 116 higher education institutions in the UAE with a cumulative enrollment of 116,912 across 644 accredited academic programs (NQA, 2013). Since there are only three federally-sponsored institutions out of the 116 qualified by the CAA, all of the other higher education institutions are international organizations or institutions that have formed partnerships or joint ventures with either the federal or local governments to establish campuses in the UAE. Due to the population concentration in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, most of the foreign institutions can be found in these two cities, with 19 institutions in Abu Dhabi and a mass of 62 institutions in Dubai (MHESR, 2015). Most of the private institutions can be found in one of the 15 economic \u201cfree zones\u201d established by the UAE federal government or local governments of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The Free Zones are special areas in the city that offer tax exemptions and other incentives to foreign companies to encourage capital investments that benefit both parties, creating a true global market in these cities within the city. The Dubai Knowledge Village and the Dubai International Academic City are the primary locations of nearly all of the private institutions of higher education, and include institutions from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, and India. The institutions found in the free zones are governed by the Dubai Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) and further managed by the University Quality Assurance International Board (UQAIB) to ensure all institutions meet the benchmarks of quality and accreditation established by the UAE government. Given the mandate that all levels of education would be free to its citizens, the government of UAE spends over a quarter of the federal budget on education. In 2009, the education budget was approximately $10 billion, or 28 percent of the federal budget for that year. In contrast, the participation rate for eligible citizens in the higher education system is still considerably lower than that of the U.S. or European countries, with only 25 percent of eligible Emiratis attending as compared to 71 percent of eligible students in North America and Western Europe (UNESCO, 2009). However, the pending \u201cboom\u201d of youth coming-of-age (65 percent of national population is under the age of 24) in the next decade has the government of UAE looking for ways to keep up the funding levels for education to maintain the quality and meet the demand from its citizens. Costs per student has already impacted the funding model given the inflation rate and increased demand for matriculation, and the government has had to freeze acceptance rates in order to limit the volume of new students in an effort to maintain the quality of instruction and services at the government-funded institutions. Projections by the MHESR indicate that over 50,000 students will be knocking at the universities\u2019 door by the beginning of the next decade (MHESR, 2007). Additionally, if the native population of UAE follows the trend of other countries in regards to adult learners returning to college, the MHESR predict that could potentially add another 13,000 students to the 50,000 youths expected to flood the higher education system if only 10 percent of the 25-29 year olds decide to enroll (MHESR, 2007). Some of the demand for education has been met by the private institutions that have set up shop in the various free zones primarily in Dubai, but these are options typically only available to the more affluent upper-middle and upper class of the socioeconomic scale. Faculty teaching in both the federal system and throughout the private institutions are heavily international. Within the UAE federal system, only approximately 10 percent of the 18 Georgia Journal of College Student Affairs, Vol. 32 [2016], Iss. 1, Art. 4 https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/gcpa/vol32/iss1/4 DOI: 10.20429/gcpa.2016.010104 2,568 full-time faculty in 2013-2014 were UAE nationals. Similarly, less than 2 percent of the 3,949 faculty teaching in the private institutions within the free zones during 2013-2014 are UAE nationals (MHESR, 2015). The mandate set by the MHESR regarding the international qualifications of its faculty had assisted the recruitment of foreign scholars in the past, however, due to a static funding level the ability for federal institutions to attract and retain top faculty has declined considerably as the salary and benefits packages offered are no longer considered to be competitive (MHESR, 2007). Additionally, studies have shown that the most popular degree offerings and largest faculty expenses are no longer congruent with the needs of the employer market. Business, engineering, and health sciences dominate the course offerings and faculty appointments across all levels of higher education in the UAE, with 50 percent of students at federal institutions pursuing these degrees; 60 percent of students at private institutions enrolled in these majors; and 60 percent of UAE nationals studying abroad studying these same majors (NQA, 2013). Areas of study with huge industry demands that are not currently being met within the UAE educational system include information technology, education, architecture and construction, natural and physical sciences, and tourism and hospitality (Kazim, 2013).\n\n==\n\nWilkins 2010:\n\nTitle: Higher education in the United Arab Emirates: an analysis of the outcomes of significant increases in supply and competition\n\nAbstract: During the last decade, several countries across the Middle and Far East have established higher education hubs, some of which have grown rapidly by attracting foreign universities to set up international branch campuses. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is by far the largest host of international branch campuses globally, having over 40 providers at the end of 2009. The UAE higher education market has become highly competitive and, in the private sector, supply currently exceeds demand.

Here, we report that networks with different functions, including the Internet, metabolic, air transportation and protein interaction networks, have distinct patterns of connections among nodes with different roles, and that, as a consequence, complex networks can be classified into two distinct functional classes on the basis of their link type frequency. Importantly, we demonstrate that these structural features cannot be captured by means of often studied global properties.\n\n==\n\nMartin 2020:\n\nTitle: Networks, Status, and Inequality\n\nAbstract: The notion that there is a single class of objects, \u201cnetworks,\u201d has been a great inspiration to new forms of structural thinking. Networks are considered to be a set of largely voluntary ties that often span organizational boundaries. Despite being divorced from formal hierarchies, they make possible other forms of differentiation, such as status. It is common for network data to be used to produce measures of the status of the nodes (individuals, organizations, cultural products, etc.) and the distribution of these statuses to describe a backdrop of inequality that may condition action or other processes. However, it is also important that network researchers understand the backdrop of various forms of potential inequality that may condition the collection of network data.\n\n==\n\nZaidi 2011:\n\nTitle: Analysis, Structure and Organization of Complex Networks\n\nAbstract: Network science has emerged as a fundamental eld of study to model many physical and real world systems around us. The discovery of small world and scale free properties of these real world networks has revolutionized the way we study, analyze, model and process these networks. In this thesis, we are interested in the study of networks having these properties often termed as complex networks. In our opinion, research conducted in this eld can be grouped into four categories, Analysis, Structure, Processes-Organization and Visualization. We address problems pertaining to each of these categories throughout this thesis. The initial chapters present an introduction and the necessary background knowledge required for readers. Chapters (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) all introduce a specic problem leading up to its solution. In Chapter 3, we present a visual analytics method to analyze complex networks. Based on this method, we also introduce a new metric to calculate the presence of densely connected vertices in networks. Chapter 4 deals with models to generate arti- cial networks having small world and scale free properties. We propose a new model to generate networks with these properties along with the presence of community structures. Extending from the results of our analysis in Chapter 3, we introduce a fast agglomerative clustering algorithm in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, we address the issue of visualizing these complex networks through a system which combines simplication, clustering and dedicated layout algorithms. Finally we address the issue of evaluating the quality of clusters for complex networks that do not have densely connected vertices in Chapter 7. Each chapter is followed by a mini-conclusion and further research prospects. In the end, we summarize our results and conclude the thesis by presenting some research directions based on our ndings.\n\n==\n\nAmaral 2000:\n\nTitle: Classes of small-world networks.\n\nAbstract: We study the statistical properties of a variety of diverse real-world networks. We present evidence of the occurrence of three classes of small-world networks: (a) scale-free networks, characterized by a vertex connectivity distribution that decays as a power law; (b) broad-scale networks, characterized by a connectivity distribution that has a power law regime followed by a sharp cutoff; and (c) single-scale networks, characterized by a connectivity distribution with a fast decaying tail. Moreover, we note for the classes of broad-scale and single-scale networks that there are constraints limiting the addition of new links. Our results suggest that the nature of such constraints may be the controlling factor for the emergence of different classes of networks.", "final_summary": "The collected papers provide a comprehensive exploration of the intersection between network analysis and class structure. \n\nStuckenschmidt (2005) discusses the application of network analysis methods to partition large concept hierarchies, highlighting the potential for identifying key concepts and determining related subsets of class hierarchies.

Time-restricted eating (TRE) in human pilot studies reduces the risks of metabolic diseases in otherwise healthy individuals. However, patients with diagnosed metabolic syndrome often undergo pharmacotherapy, and it has never been tested whether TRE can act synergistically with pharmacotherapy in animal models or humans. In a single-arm, paired-sample trial, 19 participants with metabolic syndrome and a baseline mean daily eating window of \u226514 h, the majority of whom were on a statin and/or antihypertensive therapy, underwent 10\u00a0h of TRE (all dietary intake within a consistent self-selected 10\u00a0h window) for 12\u00a0weeks. We found this TRE intervention improves cardiometabolic health for patients with metabolic syndrome receiving standard medical care including high rates of statin and anti-hypertensive use. TRE is a potentially powerful lifestyle intervention that can be added to standard medical practice to treat metabolic syndrome.

Metabolic homeostasis is regulated by the circadian rhythm. Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a type of intermittent fasting based on the circadian rhythm. In this study, we aim to analyze systemically the effects of TRE on body weight, body composition, and other metabolic parameters. We reviewed articles from PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to identify clinical trials that compared TRE to a regular diet. We included 19 studies for meta-analysis. Participants following TRE showed significantly reduced body weight (mean difference (MD), \u22120.90; 95% confidence interval (CI): \u22121.71 to \u22120.10) and fat mass (MD: \u22121.58, 95% CI: \u22122.64 to \u22120.51), while preserving fat-free mass (MD, \u22120.24; 95% CI: \u22121.15 to 0.67). TRE also showed beneficial effects on cardiometabolic parameters such as blood pressure (systolic BP, MD, \u22123.07; 95% CI: \u22125.76 to \u22120.37), fasting glucose concentration (MD, \u22122.96; 95% CI, \u22125.60 to \u22120.33), and cholesterol profiles (triglycerides, MD: \u221211.60, 95% CI: \u221223.30 to \u22120.27). In conclusion, TRE is a promising therapeutic strategy for controlling weight and improving metabolic dysfunctions in those who are overweight or obese. Further large-scale clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings and the usefulness of TRE.\n\n==\n\nManoogian 2021:\n\nTitle: A Metabolomic Analysis to Assess How Time-Restricted Eating Improves Cardiometabolic Health\n\nAbstract: Abstract Time-Restricted Eating (TRE) is a consistent 6-12-hour daily eating window without any overt caloric reduction. TRE has been shown in pre-clinical and clinical studies to have widespread benefits including improved cardiometabolic health. Most clinical trials have studied healthy or overweight participants, but the effect of TRE on patients undergoing medical treatment for cardiometabolic disease is unclear. In this single-arm paired-sample pilot study, 19 participants with metabolic syndrome and who had an eating window of 14 hours or more at baseline were put on a 10-hour TRE intervention for 3 months. Despite most participants already taking antihypertensives and statins at baseline, there were significant decreases in blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. There were also significant decreases in HbA1c, waist circumference, and body weight. To better understand the mechanism behind these improvements, here we report the changes in plasma metabolite changes following the 3-month TRE intervention. These findings are important to understand the physiological effects of TRE, especially for individuals to use as a co-treatment.\n\n==\n\nRothschild 2014:\n\nTitle: Time-restricted feeding and risk of metabolic disease: a review of human and animal studies.\n\nAbstract: Time-restricted feeding (TRF), a key component of intermittent fasting regimens, has gained considerable attention in recent years. TRF allows ad libitum energy intake within controlled time frames, generally a 3-12 hour range each day. The impact of various TRF regimens on indicators of metabolic disease risk has yet to be investigated. Accordingly, the objective of this review was to summarize the current literature on the effects of TRF on body weight and markers of metabolic disease risk (i.e., lipid, glucoregulatory, and inflammatory factors) in animals and humans. Results from animal studies show TRF to be associated with reductions in body weight, total cholesterol, and concentrations of triglycerides, glucose, insulin, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 as well as with improvements in insulin sensitivity. Human data support the findings of animal studies and demonstrate decreased body weight (though not consistently), lower concentrations of triglycerides, glucose, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. These preliminary findings show promise for the use of TRF in modulating a variety of metabolic disease risk factors.\n\n==\n\nHatori 2012:\n\nTitle: Time-restricted feeding without reducing caloric intake prevents metabolic diseases in mice fed a high-fat diet.\n\nAbstract: While diet-induced obesity has been exclusively attributed to increased caloric intake from fat, animals fed a high-fat diet (HFD) ad libitum (ad lib) eat frequently throughout day and night, disrupting the normal feeding cycle. To test whether obesity and metabolic diseases result from HFD or disruption of metabolic cycles, we subjected mice to either ad lib or time-restricted feeding (tRF) of a HFD for 8 hr per day. Mice under tRF consume equivalent calories from HFD as those with ad lib access yet are protected against obesity, hyperinsulinemia, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation and have improved motor coordination. The tRF regimen improved CREB, mTOR, and AMPK pathway function and oscillations of the circadian clock and their target genes' expression. These changes in catabolic and anabolic pathways altered liver metabolome and improved nutrient utilization and energy expenditure. We demonstrate in mice that tRF regimen is a nonpharmacological strategy against obesity and associated diseases.\n\n==\n\nManoogian 2021:\n\nTitle: Time-restricted eating for the prevention and management of metabolic diseases.\n\nAbstract: Time-restricted feeding (TRF, animal-based studies) and time-restricted eating (TRE, humans) are an emerging behavioral intervention approach based on the understanding of the role of circadian rhythms in physiology and metabolism. In this approach, all calorie intake is restricted within a consistent interval of less than 12 hours without overtly attempting to reduce calories. This article will summarize the origin of TRF/TRE starting with concept of circadian rhythms and the role of chronic circadian rhythm disruption in increasing the risk for chronic metabolic diseases. Circadian rhythms are usually perceived as the sleep-wake cycle and dependent rhythms arising from the central nervous system. However, the recent discovery of circadian rhythms in peripheral organs and the plasticity of these rhythms in response to changes in nutrition availability raised the possibility that adopting a consistent daily short window of feeding can sustain robust circadian rhythm. Preclinical animal studies have demonstrated proof of concept and identified potential mechanisms driving TRF-related benefits. Pilot human intervention studies have reported promising results in reducing the risk for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Epidemiological studies have indicated that maintaining a consistent long overnight fast, which is similar to TRE, can significantly reduce risks for chronic diseases. Despite these early successes, more\n\n==\n\nTippairote 2020:\n\nTitle: Restoration of metabolic tempo through time-restricted eating (TRE) as the preventive measure for metabolic diseases\n\nAbstract: Abstract The characteristics of healthy bioenergetics are the overall balance of energy intake and expenditure, the alternate switching for different metabolic fuels, and the temporal rhythm of eating and fasting. These three bioenergetic attributes, herein, are termed as the metabolic tempo. Cumulative studies revealed the beneficial health effects of fasting. Most of the fasting regimens harness their innate mechanisms of enhancing metabolic fuel switching, thus improving metabolic flexibility. The emerging time-restricted eating (TRE) regimen includes the restoration of diurnal eating and fasting rhythms, improve the metabolic flexibility, while spontaneously reduces the food intake despite the ad-libitum eating. TRE thus simultaneously improves all three bioenergetic-tempo attributes when compared to the energy balance control in general obesity control. We reviewed fifteen human studies of TRE and TRE-liked interventions from 2007 to 2019. These studies reported promising beneficial metabolic effects on body weight, glycemic, and lipid controls while demonstrating most of the fasting-related metabolic and epigenetic responses in overweight and obese individuals. TRE is practically possible for long-termed implementation. Despite its potentials to restore the underlying dysregulated bioenergetics., there is no study confirming that TRE could prevent the development of common metabolic diseases in healthy subjects after long-term implementation. This gap of knowledge warrants future investigation.\n\n==\n\nCharlot 2021:\n\nTitle: Beneficial Effects of Early Time-Restricted Feeding on Metabolic Diseases: Importance of Aligning Food Habits with the Circadian Clock\n\nAbstract: The importance of metabolic health is a major societal concern due to the increasing prevalence of metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and various cardiovascular diseases. The circadian clock is clearly implicated in the development of these metabolic diseases. Indeed, it regulates physiological processes by hormone modulation, thus helping the body to perform them at the ideal time of day. Since the industrial revolution, the actions and rhythms of everyday life have been modified and are characterized by changes in sleep pattern, work schedules, and eating habits. These modifications have in turn lead to night shift, social jetlag, late-night eating, and meal skipping, a group of customs that causes circadian rhythm disruption and leads to an increase in metabolic risks. Intermittent fasting, especially the time-restricted eating, proposes a solution: restraining the feeding window from 6 to 10 h per day to match it with the circadian clock. This approach seems to improve metabolic health markers and could be a therapeutic solution to fight against metabolic diseases. This review summarizes the importance of matching life habits with circadian rhythms for metabolic health and assesses the advantages and limits of the application of time-restricted fasting with the objective of treating and preventing metabolic diseases.", "final_summary": "Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a dietary approach that confines all calorie intake within a consistent interval of less than 12 hours each day.

This research aims at identifying ways to increase the market share of sustainable fish from aquaculture by analyzing consumer awareness and preferences for sustainable aquaculture products and by drawing conclusions on improving communication in the German market. An integrative research approach was used: it began with an inventory of sustainable seafood products on the German market, followed by qualitative and quantitative consumer research, and ending with a stakeholder workshop, which reflected on the research outcome with practitioners. Sustainability and country of origin proved to be of minor relevance to the vast majority of the consumers interviewed. Indeed, attributes such as freshness, taste, and price frequently ranked higher. Like most of the other consumers, the small consumer segment that is generally interested in sustainability issues of food also often lacks knowledge of fish farming and its products. Consequently, communication of sustainability in aquaculture is challenging, and the development of this market requires concerted actions along the whole value chain, with the retail sector as the main actor.\n\n==\n\nLeng 2020:\n\nTitle: Consumer Awareness And Acceptance Of Aquaculture Practices And Products In Penang, Malaysia\n\nAbstract: High demand of seafood products combined with over-harvesting of wild catch aquatic products have elevated aquaculture as the alternative way to strike a balance between seafood product supply and demand. However, uncontrolled aquaculture activities are found to affect the environment negatively as well as the health of consumers. Better awareness and understanding can regulate aquaculture practices and bring about environmental health through consumers\u2019 pressure on the aquaculture production system. This study aimed to identify consumers\u2019 perception on aquaculture industry, to study consumers\u2019 awareness on sustainability of aquaculture practice and also to find ways to increase consumers\u2019 awareness and acceptance of sustainable aquaculture practice and its products. A mixed research method was used in this study combining quantitative questionnaire survey of respondents who bought aquaculture products at wet markets in Penang, and qualitative in-depth focus group discussions (FGDs) with a number of selected respondents. Research findings show that most of the respondents are aware that aquaculture might give lots of negative effects to human health and the environment but, they still chose to buy aquaculture products due to cheaper price than wild catch seafood products. Hence, from the findings, it is clear that even though people have awareness, they have little choice but to accept the quality of aquaculture products. However, the results also show that enhancing consumer awareness and understanding empowers consumers to put pressures on producers paving the way towards sustainable aquaculture and greater acceptance of aquaculture practices and products. 2357-1330 \u00a9 2020 Published by European Publisher.\n\n==\n\nFern\u00e1ndez-Polanco 2008:\n\nTitle: Factors Affecting Consumer's Attitudes Towards Aquaculture\n\nAbstract: Attitudes towards production processes increased their importance over food purchase decissions in recent years.

Using consumer survey data, factor analysis techniques were used to obtain an attitude meassure from a set of scales. Diferent linear models and fit methods were performed with variables of the three groups of factors to test for significant effects over attitude scores.

Based on a cross-cultural survey of 2511 European participants, this research demonstrates how ethical beliefs affect consumer perceptions of \u201cblue\u201d (i.e. environmentally friendly) aquaculture products. The study further emphasises that the positive effect of ethical beliefs on purchase intention operates via an indirect route mediated by consumers\u2019 trust in a product category. Consumer involvement has limited moderation effect on the above relationships. To expand its \u201cblue\u201d business, a key policy recommendation to aquaculture product manufacturers and policy makers is to urge stable and reliable standards of control in environmentally responsible aquaculture production so that consumers can rely on the information source and increase their trust in aquaculture products.\n\n==\n\nPieniak 2013:\n\nTitle: Consumer knowledge and use of information about fish and aquaculture\n\nAbstract: This paper explores consumers\u2019 knowledge about fish and aquaculture and assesses the use and importance of different information cues about fish. Cross-sectional data were collected in 2008 through a consumer survey (n=3213) in the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Sweden and the UK. Consumers\u2019 knowledge about fish generally, and about aquaculture in particular, was relatively low and differed significantly between countries. Consumers from all countries reported an indication of quality and/or food safety as an information cue when buying fish. The information sources most frequently used by Europeans were labelling and sellers in retail or supermarkets. The Internet was identified by consumers in all of the countries as one of the most important sources of information about sea and freshwater fish products. Policy makers and food marketers are encouraged to develop a simple and easily recognisable mark (relating to quality, food safety and nutrition) to assist consumer decision-making. Information campaigns focusing on issues such as the nutritional benefits of eating fish are also recommended.\n\n==\n\nFao 1999:\n\nTitle: Food safety issues associated with products from aquaculture. Report of a Joint FAO/NACA/WHO Study Group.\n\nAbstract: The past decade has seen rapid expansion in aquaculture production. In the fisheries sector, as in animal production, farming is replacing hunting as the primary food production strategy. In future, farmed fish will be an even more important source of protein foods than they are today, and the safety for human consumption of products from aquaculture is of public health significance. This is the report of a Study Group that considered food safety issues associated with farmed finfish and crustaceans. The principal conclusion was that an integrated approach--involving close collaboration between the aquaculture, agriculture, food safety, health and education sectors--is needed to identify and control hazards associated with products from aquaculture. Food safety assurance should be included in fish farm management and form an integral part of the farm-to-table food safety continuum. Where appropriate, measures should be based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) methods; however, difficulties in applying HACCP principles to small-scale farming systems were recognized. Food safety hazards associated with products from aquaculture differ according to region, habitat and environmental conditions, as well as methods of production and management. Lack of awareness of hazards can hinder risk assessment and the application of risk management strategies to aquaculture production, and education is therefore needed. Chemical and biological hazards that should to be taken into account in public health policies concerning products from aquaculture are discussed in this report, which should be of use to policy-makers and public health officials. The report will also assist fish farmers to identify hazards and develop appropriate hazard-control strategies.\n\n==\n\nAitken 2020:\n\nTitle: The positive role of labelling on consumers\u2019 perceived behavioural control and intention to purchase organic food\n\nAbstract: Abstract The consumption of organic food has increased dramatically in recent years in response to consumers\u2019 concerns with issues related to health, well-being and the environment. However, further increases are restricted by a number of barriers, one of the most important of which is information. Using the Reasoned Action Approach (RAA), this study is the first to examine the role of product specific information (labelling) to understand the gap between consumer attitude and behavioural intention to purchase organic food products. Based on responses from 1,052 New Zealand consumers, analysis using structural equation modelling demonstrates that labelling plays an important role within the perceived behavioural control dimension of the RAA, as well as directly on attitudes, in influencing behavioural intention. The more that respondents agree that labelling is actionable, the more positive their attitude and sense of control, and hence intention and (self-reported) behaviour. These findings suggest that by improving labelling systems to include more actionable information, such as the health, environmental and societal benefits of products, consumers perceived behavioural control can be increased to strengthen intentions to purchase organic products.\n\n==\n\nClaret 2014:\n\nTitle: Consumer beliefs regarding farmed versus wild fish\n\nAbstract: Aquaculture is a food-producing activity, alternative to traditional extractive fishing, which still acts as a reference for most consumers. The main objective of the present paper was to study which consumer beliefs, regarding farmed versus wild fish, hinder the potential development of the aquaculture sector. To achieve this purpose the study was organized into two complementary steps: a qualitative approach (focus groups) aimed at assessing consumer perception about wild and farmed fish and to identify the salient beliefs that differentiate them; and a quantitative approach (survey by means of a questionnaire) to validate the results obtained in the focus group discussions over a representative sample of participants (n = 919). Results showed that participants perceive clear differences between farmed and wild fish. Although no significant differences between both kinds of fish were detected on safety, in general farmed fish was perceived to be less affected by marine pollution, heavy metals and parasites. In the contrary, wild fish was considered to have healthier feeding, to contain fewer antibiotics and to be fresher, healthier, less handled and more natural. Beliefs related to quality were in favour of wild fish, while those related to availability and price were in favour of farmed fish. Significant differences were observed in the perception of both kinds of fish depending on the consumers' objective knowledge about fish, on the level of education, age and gender and on the three segments of consumers identified: \"Traditional/Conservative\", \"Connoisseur\", \"Open to aquaculture\". The results provided could play an important role when planning and designing efficient marketing strategies for promoting farmed fish by adapting the information provided to the perception of each segment of consumers identified by the present study.", "final_summary": "The relationship between general knowledge, awareness, and perceived behavioral control towards food products, particularly unfamiliar low trophic level aquaculture products, is a complex interplay influenced by various factors. \n\nZander (2018) and Leng (2020) both highlight that consumer awareness of sustainable aquaculture products is relatively low.

CNF can be extracted from various natural resource by several means. However, the size of the extracted CNF is very broad and uniformity of the extracted CNF is very important for many applications. Thus, a fractionation process is necessary to obtain a uniformly sized CNF. In this paper, a simple centrifugal fractionation was carried out to reduce the size distribution of the extracted CNF suspension from hardwood pulp by the combination of TEMPO oxidation and aqueous counter collision methods. The original CNF suspension was diluted and centrifuged under low speed to remove cellulose microfibers then centrifuged under high speed to separate very small CNF. The centrifugation condition is 10 k rpm for 1 h followed by 45 k rpm for 4 h. The fractionated CNF was analyzed by an atomic force microscopy, and the length and width distribution histogram analysis was utilized. UV\u2013visible analysis, FT-IR and XRD crystallinity analysis were carried out to analyze all fractionated CNFs and the original CNF. After centrifugal fractionation, the width and length distribution range were reduced by 62% and 70%, respectively.

However, extraordinarily high centrifugal accelerations are required for even smaller particles. For this purpose, we make use of magnetic bearing and drive technology. We report the first application of this contactless technique in separation experiments. The presented prototype is based on a semi-continuous principle, where sediment is built up within the rotor while the liquid (which contains the fine fraction in case of classification) is discharged at the overflow weir. The new centrifuge allows rotational speeds of more than 64k\u00a0min \u22121 . A broad variation of parameters with centrifugal accelerations of up to C =100,000 and flow rates of up to 0.4\u00a0l/min provides a sound experimental basis for this study. The cut size and the product loss of three particle systems between 10\u00a0nm and 1\u00a0\u00b5m (silver nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles, and polystyrene) are precisely adjustable via the mentioned parameters. Furthermore, a good comparability with a commercially available device was found regarding the specific efficiency.

The gained mass-weighted particle size distribution is however often reported to be broad, requiring post treatment like centrifugation to remove undesired particle size fractions. To date, available centrifugation techniques are generally discontinuous, limiting the throughput and hindering economic upscaling. Hence, throughout this paper, a scalable, continuously operating centrifugation of laser-generated platinum NPs in a tubular bowl centrifuge is reported for the first time. To that end, using a 121 W ns-laser, the continuous production of a colloidal suspension of NPs, yet with broad particle size distribution has been employed, yielding productivities of 1\u20132 g h\u22121 for gold, silver, and platinum. The power-specific productivities (Au: 18 mg h\u22121 W\u22121, Pt: 13 mg h\u22121 W\u22121, Ag: 8 mg h\u22121 W\u22121, Ni: 6 mg h\u22121 W\u22121) are far higher than reported before. Subsequent downstream integration of a continuously operating tubular bowl centrifuge was successfully achieved for Pt NPs allowing the removal of undesired particle size with high throughput. By means of a systematic study of relevant centrifugation parameters involved, effective size optimization and respective size sharpness parameters for a maximum Pt NP diameter of 10 nm are reported. The results of the experimental centrifugation of laser-generated Pt NPs were in excellent agreement with the theoretically calculated cut-off diameter. After centrifugation with optimized parameters (residence time of 5 min; g-force of 38,454 g), the polydispersity indices of the Pt NPs size distributions were reduced by a factor of six, and high monodispersity was observed.\n\n==\n\nZhang 2014:\n\nTitle: Centrifugal Spinning: An Alternative Approach to Fabricate Nanofibers at High Speed and Low Cost\n\nAbstract: Nanofibers are an important class of material that is useful in a variety of applications, including filtration, tissue engineering, protective clothing, battery separators, energy storage, etc. So far, electrospinning is the most used method for producing nanofibers. However, the wide-spread commercial use of electrospinning is limited mainly due to its low production rate. Most other nanofiber production methods, such as melt-blowing, bicomponent fiber spinning, phase separation, template synthesis, and self-assembly, are complex and can only be used to make nanofibers from limited types of polymers. Centrifugal spinning is an alternative method for producing nanofibers from various materials at high speed and low cost. In centrifugal spinning, the spinning fluid is placed in a rotating spinning head. When the rotating speed reaches a critical value, the centrifugal force overcomes the surface tension of the spinning fluid to eject a liquid jet from the nozzle tip of the spinning head. The jet then undergoes a stretching process and is eventually deposited on the collector, forming solidified nanofibers. Centrifugal spinning is simple and enables the rapid fabrication of nanofibers for various applications. This article gives an overview on the centrifugal spinning process, and compares it with conventional nanofiber production methods.\n\n==\n\nKwon 2013:\n\nTitle: Separation of different sized nanoparticles with time using a rotational flow\n\nAbstract: In this paper, we describe the development of a microfluidic centrifuge with two inlets and two outlets potentially capable of rapidly separating nanoparticles and nanovesicles. Compared with the microfluidic centrifuge with a single inlet and outlet, the 2 \u00d72 microfluidic centrifuge gives improved centrifugation performance by increasing momentum flux transfer, angular velocity, and centrifugal acceleration. The center of flow rotation and the symmetry of the horizontal velocity in the microchamber were examined numerically. On the basis of the determined maximum velocity, the angular velocity and centrifugal acceleration were also evaluated. The centrifugation time of three different nanoparticles was examined by calculating the time when the nanoparticles left the microchamber for the first time. For visual observation and quantitative measurement of nanoparticle centrifugation, a 2 \u00d72 microfluidic centrifuge was fabricated and the experimental results demonstrate similar physical behavior to those of a mechanical centrifuge. On the basis of a comparison of the centrifugation time of two different nanoparticle populations of 300 and 700 nm in diameter, we propose that nanoparticles of different sizes can be physically separated by time under a range of inlet volume flow rates.\n\n==\n\nKwon 2013:\n\nTitle: Separation of Different Sized Nanoparticles with Time Using a Rotational Flow\n\nAbstract: In this paper, we describe the development of a microfluidic centrifuge with two inlets and two outlets potentially capable of rapidly separating nanoparticles and nanovesicles.

However, the utilization of a high-voltage setup and the low production rate have become barriers to its use in large scale. Centrifugal spinning is an efficient approach to producing nanofibers from various materials. During centrifugal spinning, the polymer solution or polymer melt is ejected out of the rotating spinning head, and when the centrifugal force overcomes the surface tension of the polymer liquid material, the polymer jet undergoes a stretching process and is eventually deposited on the collector, forming solidified nanofibers. This chapter gives an overview of the history, working mechanism, influential parameters, and various applications of the centrifugal spinning method.\n\n==\n\nSatish 2022:\n\nTitle: A mini review on centrifugal spinning technique for production of nanofibers and its applications in drug delivery\n\nAbstract: Nanofibers possess distinctive physicochemical and biological properties and have been utilized in a wide range of research and commercial applications. Electrospinning is a widely used technology for generating nanofibers, but due to its low production rate, it lacks scalability. Centrifugal spinning is a low-cost process for producing nanofibers that is simple, quick, and scalable. It has emerged as a potential technology for fabricating nanofibers with a variety of applications due to its extremely high production rate and multifaceted features. The centrifugal spinning process involves injecting the polymer solution or melt in a rotating spinneret. When the spinning head reaches a critical speed, the centrifugal force overcomes the surface tension of the spinning liquid, and a liquid jet ejects from the nozzle tip. The jet is then stretched further, resulting in solidified nanofibers on the collector. The technique is capable of producing 3D nanofiber scaffolds from various polymers for biomedical applications. This paper describes in details the centrifugal spinning process, its classification, principle and applications of the centrifugal spun nano/micro fibers in drug delivery and wound dressing.

I found that allocation of resources worsened before 2010 and improved afterwards. Initially, misallocation of intermediate inputs was the major source of aggregate TFP losses, while the importance of capital misallocation increased after the financial crisis. Determinants of changes in allocation efficiency may include growing competition in domestic markets, tighter credit supply and legal issues. However, I show that fragmentation of production induces bias to the estimates of firm-specific distortions. Thus, in the absence of inter-firm trade data, the conclusions on misallocation should be treated with some caution.\n\n==\n\nNicola 2020:\n\nTitle: Productivity Loss and Misallocation of Resources in Southeast Asia\n\nAbstract: This paper examines within-sector resource misallocation in three Southeast Asian countries -- Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The methodology accounts for measurement error in revenues and costs. The firm-level evidence suggests that measurement error is substantial, resulting in an overestimation of misallocation by as much as 30 percent. Nevertheless, resource misallocation across firms within a sector remains large, albeit declining. The findings imply that there are considerable potential gains from efficient reallocation -- above 80 percent for Indonesia and around 20 to 30 percent for Malaysia and Vietnam. Private domestic firms and firms with higher productivity appear to face larger distortions that prevent them from expanding.\n\n==\n\nWei 2017:\n\nTitle: Resource misallocation in Chinese manufacturing enterprises: evidence from firm-level data\n\nAbstract: Abstract Despite the important policy and welfare implications of China's energy issues, to date there has been little investigation from a micro-level perspective of the misallocation of resources in manufacturing enterprises. To fill this gap, this paper deals with resource misallocations in China with special reference to energy and labor inputs. Using a large, novel dataset of manufacturing enterprises from Zhejiang province, we employ a simultaneous system of equations for (gross) industrial output value, wage bill, energy expenditure and carbon emissions. The explanatory variables include labor, educational attainment of employees, capital value, materials, and a list of energy-related variables. Our results show that, for the same energy content, non-coal energy inputs are more productive than coal and coal-related fuels. Non-coal energy is more environmentally friendly but more expensive than coal-related fuels. Using the model estimates, we conduct Wald tests on whether the marginal productivity of labor and energy significantly differ from their respective factor costs. The main findings are that there is substantial resource misallocation in manufacturing enterprises, with labor being underpaid and energy overpaid, on average, in comparison to their marginal productivity. For energy misallocation, however, the pattern varies considerably among the various subsectors. Specifically, energy is over-used in sectors such as Textile , Paper , Chemical , Plastics , Non-metallic , Ferrous metals and Non-ferrous metal . By contrast, energy is under-used in sectors such as Beverages , Textile-wearing apparel , Leather , Metal , Transport equipment , Electrical machinery and Communication equipment . These findings can assist decision-makers in targeting the sectors where there is the most misallocation, identifying which input factors are inappropriately used, improving economic efficiency and lowering overall production costs by reducing allocative inefficiency.\n\n==\n\nNguyen 2016:\n\nTitle: Resource Misallocation in Turkey\n\nAbstract: This paper examines resource misallocation within narrow industries in Turkey. It finds that resource misallocation in Turkey is substantial. The hypothetical gain from moving to\"U.S. efficiency\"is 24.5 percent of manufacturing total factor productivity in 2014. The evolution of resource misallocation over time and across disaggregated sectors is also examined. Improvement in allocative efficiency was sizable between 2003 and 2013, but significantly slower after 2007. However, the earlier trend reversed in 2014 and resource misallocation worsened in Turkey's manufacturing. The cross-sector analysis reveals that misallocation is most pronounced in textiles, transport, food, and leather.\n\n==\n\nLai-qu 2015:\n\nTitle: Effect of Administrative Monopoly on Resources Misallocation Caused by Ownership Differences\n\nAbstract: Based on the monopolistic competition model of heterogeneous enterprises,this paper puts forward the measuring model which is used to measure the degree of resources misallocation caused by the differences of ownership.Using Chinese industrial enterprises data,this paper measures the degree of resources misallocation.The results show that,although the degree of resources misallocation is on decline in the long time,it is still very serious.From 1998 to 2007,the ownership differences led to industrial total factor productivity(TFP) loss more than 200%every year.The degree of labor misallocation approached 100%,and the degree of capital misallocation was approximately 50%.This paper also shows us that the fundamental reason for resources misallocation caused by ownership differences is not just ownership differences itself,but administrative monopoly which is defined as the combination between administrative power of government and monopoly of state\u2014owned enterprises.Through governing financial system which is predominated by state-owned banks,the administrative departments bring the state-owned enterprises lower financing cost.Meanwhile through setting market entry barriers,controlling price,and providing lower financing cost,the administrative departments bring the state-owned enterprises higher profit and employee welfare,and then lead to capital and labor misallocation.\n\n==\n\nHe 2021:\n\nTitle: Resource Misallocation and Energy-Related Pollution\n\nAbstract: Developing countries face the conflict between economic development and environmental protection. Resource misallocation will not only affect the effectiveness of economic development, but also have environmental impacts. Based on two large-scale enterprise databases in China, this paper measured the level of enterprise resource allocation, and further used empirical research methods to investigate the environmental impact of enterprise resource misallocation and specific mechanisms. The results show that the low efficiency of resource allocation will harm the quality of China\u2019s environment. Further investigation, resource misallocation is accompanied by an increase in total energy input, a decrease in the labor-to-energy ratio and the capital-to-energy ratio, and a loss of energy efficiency, which in turn affects the environmental performance of enterprises. China is the largest developing country in the world, and research on China\u2019s environmental and economic issues is important.

We build on this research to further investigate the drivers of misallocation, exploiting micro-level variation across Indian states. We find that states with less rigid labor markets have lesser misallocation. We also examine the interaction of labor market rigidities with informality which is a key feature of India\u2019s labor markets. Our results suggest that reducing labor market rigidities in states with high informality has a net positive effect on aggregate productivity.\n\n==\n\nJia 2014:\n\nTitle: How Does Government Intervention Lead to Regional Resource Misallocation\u2014\u2014Based on Decomposition of Misallocation within and between Industries\n\nAbstract: This paper extends the Hsieh and Klenow model to measure the resource misallocation from the industry level.It compares the levels of misallocation in China's different areas and tests the government's policy factors by regression.The results indicate that the overall and within-industry misallocation index firsdy decreases,and then increases,however,the between-industry misallocation index increases all the time.The level of misallocation in the central and western regions is higher than that of the eastern region.The misallocation withinindustry and between-industry induces 30.25% and 4.72% gap between real output and potential output respectively.Fiscal subsidy,financial depression and administrative barrier have significant effects on the misallocation within-industry,and labor mobility control and financial depression influence the misallocation betweenindustry.It has important policy implications for China's economic reform to promote the process of marketization and regional TFP growth.", "final_summary": "The research question \"Misallocation of Resources\" has been extensively studied across various countries and sectors.

Sulforaphane was found to be active against several forms of cancer. A growing body of data shows that sulforaphane acts against cancer at different levels, from development to progression, through pleiotropic effects. In this review, we discuss the available experimental and clinical data on the potential therapeutic role of sulforaphane against cancer. Its effects range from the protection of cells from DNA damage to the modulation of the cell cycle via pro-apoptotic, anti-angiogenesis and anti-metastasis activities. At molecular level, sulforaphane modulates cellular homeostasis via the activation of the transcription factor Nrf2. Although data from clinical studies are limited, sulforaphane remains a good candidate in the adjuvant therapy based on natural molecules against several types of cancer.\n\n==\n\nGamet-Payrastre 2000:\n\nTitle: Sulforaphane, a naturally occurring isothiocyanate, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HT29 human colon cancer cells.\n\nAbstract: Sulforaphane is an isothiocyanate that is present naturally in widely consumed vegetables and has a particularly high concentration in broccoli. This compound has been shown to block the formation of tumors initiated by chemicals in the rat. Although sulforaphane has been proposed to modulate the metabolism of carcinogens, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated that sulforaphane inhibits the reinitiation of growth and decreases the cellular viability of quiescent human colon carcinoma cells (HT29). Moreover, the weak effect observed on differentiated CaCo2 cells suggests a specific anticancer activity for this compound. Here we investigated the effect of sulforaphane on the growth and viability of HT29 cells during their exponentially growing phase. We observed that sulforaphane induced a cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner, followed by cell death. This sulforaphane-induced cell cycle arrest was correlated with an increased expression of cyclins A and B1. Moreover, we clearly demonstrated that sulforaphane induced cell death via an apoptotic process. Indeed, a large proportion of treated cells display the following: (a) translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner layer to the outer layer of the plasma membrane; (b) typical chromatin condensation; and (c) ultrastructural modifications related to apoptotic cell death. We also showed that the expression of p53 was not changed in sulforaphane-treated cells. In contrast, whereas bcl-2 was not detected, we observed increased expression of the proapoptotic protein bax, the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, and the proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that in addition to the activation of detoxifying enzymes, induction of apoptosis is also involved in the sulforaphane-associated chemoprevention of cancer.\n\n==\n\nFahey 2002:\n\nTitle: Sulforaphane inhibits extracellular, intracellular, and antibiotic-resistant strains of Helicobacter pylori and prevents benzo[a]pyrene-induced stomach tumors\n\nAbstract: Gastric infection with Helicobacter pylori is a cosmopolitan problem, and is especially common in developing regions where there is also a high prevalence of gastric cancer. These infections are known to cause gastritis and peptic ulcers, and dramatically enhance the risk of gastric cancer. Eradication of this organism is an important medical goal that is complicated by the development of resistance to conventional antimicrobial agents and by the persistence of a low level reservoir of H. pylori within gastric epithelial cells. Moreover, economic and practical problems preclude widespread and intensive use of antibiotics in most developing regions. We have found that sulforaphane [(\u2212)-1-isothiocyanato-(4R)-(methylsulfinyl)butane], an isothiocyanate abundant as its glucosinolate precursor in certain varieties of broccoli and broccoli sprouts, is a potent bacteriostatic agent against 3 reference strains and 45 clinical isolates of H. pylori [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for 90% of the strains is \u22644 \u03bcg/ml], irrespective of their resistance to conventional antibiotics. Further, brief exposure to sulforaphane was bactericidal, and eliminated intracellular H. pylori from a human epithelial cell line (HEp-2). In complementary experiments, sulforaphane blocked benzo[a]pyrene-evoked forestomach tumors in ICR mice. This protection resulted from induction of phase 2 detoxication and antioxidant enzymes, and was abrogated in mice lacking the nrf2 gene, which regulates phase 2 enzymes. Thus, the dual actions of sulforaphane in inhibiting Helicobacter infections and blocking gastric tumor formation offer hope that these mechanisms might function synergistically to provide diet-based protection against gastric cancer in humans.\n\n==\n\nDo 2010:\n\nTitle: Development of sulforaphane-encapsulated microspheres for cancer epigenetic therapy.\n\nAbstract: Even though conventional chemotherapeutic management of cancer has reduced morbidity and mortality to a great extent, virtually all chemotherapeutic agents cause damage to healthy cells, necessitating exploration of novel anticancer agents that exert their effects through an alternate mode of action. Objectives of our research were twofold. First, we explored the promising potential of histone deacetylase inhibitor sulforaphane for epigenetic therapy for cancer as this therapeutic approach aims to reverse aberrant epigenetic modifications that affect gene expression. In vitro cell culture studies performed using B16 and S91 melanoma cells showed that sulforaphane inhibited growth and proliferation of cancer cells by downregulating deacetylation enzymes. The second part of our research investigated polymeric drug delivery systems to increase therapeutic efficacy and to minimize potential side effects of R,S-sulforaphane. Albumin microspheres encapsulating sulforaphane were developed by spray drying. Microspheres were characterized for their morphology, size and zeta potential. Cell culture studies using melanoma cells and in vivo studies in melanoma tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice demonstrated that albumin based polymeric delivery system was efficacious and has the potential to enhance the therapeutic effect and anticancer activity of sulforaphane.\n\n==\n\nShan 2006:\n\nTitle: Effect of sulforaphane on cell growth, G(0)/G(1) phase cell progression and apoptosis in human bladder cancer T24 cells.\n\nAbstract: Isothiocyanates (ITCs) from cruciferous vegetables have been shown to be effective in blocking initiation as well as progression of a range of chemically-induced tumors in animal models. In this study, sulforaphane, the most extensively studied ITC, was found to suppress the growth of T24 bladder cancer cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Sulforaphane inhibited the proliferation of T24 cells with IC(5)0 values 26.9 and 15.9 microM following 24 and 48 h treatments. Sulforaphane (5-20 microM) induced early apoptosis and blocked cell cycle progression at G(0)/G(1) phase which was associated with upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 expression. These results support a role for sulforaphane as an effective agent in the chemoprevention of bladder cancer.\n\n==\n\nHo 2009:\n\nTitle: Dietary sulforaphane, a histone deacetylase inhibitor for cancer prevention.\n\nAbstract: The reversible acetylation of histones is an important mechanism of gene regulation. During prostate cancer progression, specific modifications in acetylation patterns on histones are apparent. Targeting the epigenome, including the use of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, is a novel strategy for cancer chemoprevention. Recently, drugs classified as HDAC inhibitors have shown promise in cancer clinical trials. We have previously found that sulforaphane (SFN), a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, inhibits HDAC activity in human colorectal and prostate cancer cells. Based on the similarity of SFN metabolites and other phytochemicals to known HDAC inhibitors, we previously demonstrated that sulforaphane acted as an HDAC inhibitor in the prostate, causing enhanced histone acetylation, derepression of P21 and Bax, and induction of cell cycle arrest/apoptosis, leading to cancer prevention. The ability of SFN to target aberrant acetylation patterns, in addition to effects on phase 2 enzymes, may make it an effective chemoprevention agent. These studies are important because of the potential to qualify or change recommendations for high-risk prostate cancer patients and thereby increase their survival through simple dietary choices incorporating easily accessible foods into their diets. These studies also will provide a strong scientific foundation for future large-scale human clinical intervention studies.\n\n==\n\nJiang 2018:\n\nTitle: Chemopreventive activity of sulforaphane\n\nAbstract: Cancer is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Carcinogenesis is a multistep process induced by genetic and epigenetic changes that disrupt pathways controlling cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and senescence. In this context, many bioactive dietary compounds from vegetables and fruits have been demonstrated to be effective in cancer prevention and intervention. Over the years, sulforaphane (SFN), found in cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to have chemopreventive activity in vitro and in vivo. SFN protects cells from environmental carcinogens and also induces growth arrest and/or apoptosis in various cancer cells. In this review, we will discuss several potential mechanisms of the chemopreventive activity of SFN, including regulation of Phase I and Phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes, cell cycle arrest, and induction of apoptosis, especially via regulation of signaling pathways such as Nrf2-Keap1 and NF-\u03baB. Recent studies suggest that SFN can also affect the epigenetic control of key genes and greatly influence the initiation and progression of cancer. This research may provide a basis for the clinical use of SFN for cancer chemoprevention and enable us to design preventive strategies for cancer management, reduce cancer development and recurrence, and thus improve patient survival.", "final_summary": "Sulforaphane, a phytochemical found in cruciferous vegetables, has been extensively studied for its potential role in cancer prevention and treatment.

In this work, the polar cross-linked polystyrene/sulfur (PCP/S) composite with a sulfur content of 58\u202fwt% is firstly synthesized as the cathodes for Li-S batteries, in which these polar cross-linked polystyrene agents effectively adsorb polysulfides with a large specific surface area and various functional groups, resulting in an enhancement of the cycle performance and coulombic efficiency for Li-S batteries. The first specific discharge capacity of the PCP/S cathode is 1309.7\u202fmAh\u202fg\u22121 at 0.2\u202fC, which can remain as high as 659.7\u202fmAh\u202fg\u22121 after 400\u202fcycles with a low capacity decay of 0.124% per cycle.\n\n==\n\nGao 2019:\n\nTitle: Strong charge polarization effect enabled by surface oxidized titanium nitride for lithium-sulfur batteries\n\nAbstract: The commercialization of high-energy-density and low-cost lithium-sulfur batteries has been severely impeded by capacity fading and electrochemical polarization. Here we report a strategy to entrap polysulfides and boost the cathodic redox kinetics by embedding the surface oxidized quantum-dot-size TiN (TiN-O) within the highly ordered mesoporous carbon matrix. While the carbon scaffold offers sufficient electrical contact to the insulate sulfur, benefiting the full usage of sulfur and physical confinement of polysulfides. The surface oxygen renders TiN-O with a strong charge polarization effect for polysulfides via S-O-Ti bond as verified experimentally and theoretically. The suppressed shuttle effect and high lithium ion diffusion coefficient (7.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128\u2009cm2\u2009s\u22121) lead to a high capacity of 1264\u2009mA\u2009h\u2009g\u22121 at 0.2\u2009C with a negligible capacity fading rate of 0.06% per cycle. Additionally, TiN-O based prototype soft-package cells also exhibit excellent cycling stability with flexibility, demonstrating their potential for practical applications.Capacity fading and electrochemical polarization pose barriers to the commercial use of lithium-sulfur batteries. Here the authors show improved charge polarization and electrochemical performance in a surface oxidized quantum-dot-size titanium nitride embedded within a highly ordered mesoporous carbon matrix.\n\n==\n\nHu 2016:\n\nTitle: Alleviating polarization by designing ultrasmall Li2S nanocrystals encapsulated in N-rich carbon as a cathode material for high-capacity, long-life Li\u2013S batteries\n\nAbstract: Lithium sulfide (Li2S), which has a high theoretical specific capacity of 1166 mA h g\u22121, has potential application in cathode materials because of its high safety and compatibility with lithium-free anodes for Li\u2013S batteries. However, its low electron conductivity and lithium transfer cause significant polarization in Li2S electrodes. Here, we demonstrate the use of ultrasmall Li2S nanocrystals encapsulated in N-rich carbon (NRC) as a cathode material for Li\u2013S batteries. By evaporating a mixture of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and Li2S in dimethylformamide (DMF) solution and then subjecting the mixture to carbonization, a nano-Li2S@NRC composite with ultrasmall Li2S well dispersed in its carbon matrix was successfully synthesized. The obviously lower potential barriers and excellent cycling performance of nano-Li2S@NRC electrodes confirm their improved polarization because of the size effect of Li2S nanocrystals and the good electron transfer between Li2S and N-doped carbon. The nano-Li2S@NRC cathode delivers a high initial specific capacity of 1046 mA h g\u22121 of Li2S (\u223c1503 mA h g\u22121 of S) at 0.25C and 958 mA h g\u22121 of Li2S (\u223c1376 mA h g\u22121 of S) at 0.5C with a favorable cycling performance with an \u223c0.041% decay rate per cycle over 1000 cycles.\n\n==\n\nWang 2018:\n\nTitle: Advances in Polar Materials for Lithium\u2013Sulfur Batteries\n\nAbstract: Lithium\u2013sulfur batteries are regarded as promising candidates for energy storage devices due to their high theoretical energy density. Various approaches are proposed to break through the obstacles that are preventing Li\u2013S batteries from realizing practical application. Recently, the importance of the strong chemical interaction between polar materials and polysulfides is recognized by researchers to improve the performance of Li\u2013S batteries, especially with respect to the shuttle effect. Polar materials, unlike nonpolar materials, exhibit strong interactions with polysulfides without any modification or doping because of their intrinsic polarity, absorbing the polar polysulfides and thus suppressing the notorious shuttle effect. The recent advances on polar materials for Li\u2013S batteries are reviewed here, especially the chemical polar\u2013polar interaction effects toward immobilizing dissolved polysulfides, and the relationship between the intrinsic properties of the polar materials and the electrochemical performance of the Li\u2013S batteries are discussed. Polar materials, including polar inorganics in the cathode and polar organics as binder for the Li\u2013S batteries are respectively described. Finally, future directions and prospects for the polar materials used in Li\u2013S batteries are also proposed.\n\n==\n\nShen 2019:\n\nTitle: Stable cycling of lithium-sulfur batteries by optimizing the cycle condition\n\nAbstract: Abstract Lithium-sulfur (Li\u2013S) batteries suffer from poor utilization of active material and short cycle life due to the complicated multi-step reaction mechanisms. Herein, three conditional cycling methods, i.e. asymmetrical cycling, constant voltage (CV) discharge cycling, and partial cycling are designed in order to increase the cyclability of Li\u2013S batteries. It is found that the solid deposition process that takes place during the lower plateau of discharge is the major limiting step for achieving high discharge capacity and cycle retention, and the cathode surface coverage can be deferred by applying an optimal discharge/charge rate and CV discharge cycling. The asymmetrical cycling renders a specific capacity of ca. 700 mAh g\u22121 after 200 cycles, 30% higher than that under symmetrical cycling, while applying a CV discharge cycling enables a full retention of target specific capacity of ca. 800 mAh g\u22121 over 50 cycles. The partial cycling with a low number of phase transformation steps and reduced surface coverage at the end of discharge/charge also enhances cyclability. This work paves the way for understanding and improving the cycling performance of Li\u2013S batteries without increasing the cost of electrode design or changing the configuration of the cell.\n\n==\n\nZhang 2021:\n\nTitle: A Li-S battery with ultrahigh cycling stability and enhanced rate capability based on novel ZnO yolk-shell sulfur host\n\nAbstract: Abstract Currently, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries still suffer from fast capacity decay, poor coulombic efficiency (CE) and short cycling lifespan, which result from the severe shuttle effect issue caused by high solubility and rapid diffusion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in organic electrolytes. Here, yolk-shell zinc oxide (YS-ZnO) spheres are synthesized and for the first time, applied as a host for Li-S batteries to tackle this challenge. The polar ZnO exhibits high chemical anchoring ability toward LiPSs while the unique yolk-shell structure not only provides an additional physical barrier to LiPSs but also enables much more uniform sulfur distribution, thus significantly suppressing LiPSs shuttling effect meanwhile promoting sulfur conversion reactions. As a result, the YS-ZnO enables the Li-S battery to display an initial specific capacity of 1355\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121 and an outstanding capacity retention capability (~89.44% retention rate) even after 500 cycles with the average CE of ~99.46% at the current of 0.5 C. By contrast, the capacity of conventional-ZnO-nanoparticles based battery severely decays to 472\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121 after cycling for 500 times. More impressively, the S/YS-ZnO based Li-S battery can maintain a low decay rate of 0.040% every cycle and high average CE of 98.82% over 1000 cycles at 3 C.\n\n==\n\nPang 2016:\n\nTitle: Long-Life and High-Areal-Capacity Li-S Batteries Enabled by a Light-Weight Polar Host with Intrinsic Polysulfide Adsorption.\n\nAbstract: Lithium-sulfur batteries are attractive electrochemical energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density and very high natural abundance of sulfur. However, practically, Li-S batteries suffer from short cycling life and low sulfur utilization, particularly in the case of high-sulfur-loaded cathodes. Here, we report on a light-weight nanoporous graphitic carbon nitride (high-surface-area g-C3N4) that enables a sulfur electrode with an ultralow long-term capacity fade rate of 0.04% per cycle over 1500 cycles at a practical C/2 rate. More importantly, it exhibits good high-sulfur-loading areal capacity (up to 3.5 mAh cm(-2)) with stable cell performance. We demonstrate the strong chemical interaction of g-C3N4 with polysulfides using a combination of spectroscopic experimental studies and first-principles calculations. The 53.5% concentration of accessible pyridinic nitrogen polysulfide adsorption sites is shown to be key for the greatly improved cycling performance compared to that of N-doped carbons.", "final_summary": "The research question \"polarization in the charge cycle of Li-S battery\" has been extensively explored in recent years.

The paper examines some problems associated with using ordinary least squares solutions in models containing multicollinearity.

The feature space representation can result in a large increase in the number of parameters used by the algorithm. In order to combat this \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d, the algorithm allows the use of kernel functions, as used in Support Vector methods. We also discuss a powerful family of kernel functions which is constructed using the ANOVA decomposition method from the kernel corresponding to splines with an infinite number of nodes. This paper introduces a regression estimation algorithm which is a combination of these two elements: the dual version of Ridge Regression is applied to the ANOVA enhancement of the infinitenode splines. Experimental results are then presented (based on the Boston Housing data set) which indicate the performance of this algorithm relative to other algorithms.", "final_summary": "Ridge Regression, a variant of ordinary multiple linear regression, is a technique designed to address the issue of multicollinearity in data sets. Multicollinearity arises when predictor variables are highly correlated, leading to unreliable and unstable estimates in ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models. This problem is common in fields such as food technology and family studies. Ridge Regression is proposed as a solution to this problem by Newell (1981) and Kidwell (1982).\n\nRidge Regression introduces a degree of bias into the regression estimates, which can lead to substantial reductions in the variance and, consequently, improvements in the prediction accuracy (Hoerl, 1970; Marquardt, 1975). The technique involves the use of a biasing parameter, k, which is carefully chosen to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimates (Khalaf, 2013; Hoerl, 1975).\n\nThe application of Ridge Regression extends beyond linear problems. Saunders (1998) discusses a dual version of Ridge Regression that allows for non-linear regression by constructing a linear regression function in a high-dimensional feature space. This approach, combined with the use of kernel functions, helps to combat the \"curse of dimensionality\" that often arises in high-dimensional data analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, Ridge Regression provides a robust and versatile tool for dealing with multicollinearity in both linear and non-linear regression problems. Hoerl and Kennard showed in 1970 that regression coefficients estimated by their \u201cridge regression\u201d methods have smaller mean squared error than those estimated by least squares (Hoerl, 1981).

Economic reforms on both demand side and supply side have largely contributed to successes of the economy. Since 1990, the economic development has been impressive, even if Vietnam was strongly affected by the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998. The high economic growth was achieved in a stable macroeconomic situation. Inflation was kept within a controllable range. As a consequence of its integration into the world economy and its economic reforms, Vietnam has benefited from inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign exchange expansion. Undoubtedly, the macroeconomic policies have played an important role in stabilizing the economy in this period. However the slowdown of economic growth during the Asian crisis has raised the need for suitable adjustments in economic policies to speed up the economic development. The objective of this paper is to analyze the impacts of short-term macroeconomic policy\u2019 s adjustments in Vietnam. These impacts are investigated by employed a macro-econometric model with the assumption of demand determined economy in the short term. Based on the characteristics of transition period, Vietnamese economy\u2019 s model is constructed and adjustments of fiscal policy and exchange rate policy are analyzed since 1998, when Vietnamese economic growth has been slowing down. Fiscal relaxation and exchange rate devaluation are two main policies which is suggested for promoting growth in this period.\n\n==\n\nAnwar 2011:\n\nTitle: Financial development and economic growth in Vietnam\n\nAbstract: By making use of a panel dataset that covers 61 provinces of Vietnam over the period 1997 to 2006, this paper examines the link between financial development and economic growth. Our analysis, which is based on endogenous growth theory, reveals that financial development has contributed to economic growth in Vietnam. We find that high ratio of credit to Gross Provincial Product (GPP) has accelerated economic growth in Vietnam. We also found a strong positive link between financial development and economic growth when alternative measures of financial development were used. The impact of foreign direct investment on economic growth will be stronger if more resources are invested in financial market development.\n\n==\n\nLim 2014:\n\nTitle: Economic Growth and Employment in Vietnam\n\nAbstract: Economic Growth and Employment in Vietnam. By David Lim. London and New York: Routledge, 2014. Pp. 181. This book provides a comprehensive overview of Vietnam's economy and employment issues, which have undergone dramatic changes over the last twenty-five years. Economic Growth and Employment in Vietnam is written by David Lim of Griffith University (Australia) and Technological and Higher Education Institute (Hong Kong) as a result of his work done for the International Labour Organization (ILO) in preparation for Vietnam's Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan 2011-15. With the exclusion of the preface, the book is presented in four parts. The first part (Chapters 1-3) focuses on economic and non-economic achievements and employment creation during the twenty-five years of economic renovation. The second part (Chapters 4-8) examines different aspects that, according to the author, have influences and relationships with employment creation of the country. The third part (Chapters 9-11) discusses the demand for skilled workers and the higher education and vocational training system to meet this demand. The fourth concludes and presents some policy recommendations and proposes an approach to future reforms and changes. Its message delivered to policymakers of Vietnam is apparent: despite the remarkable performance of the economy and human development during the past few decades, employment creation from economic growth is lower than expected. The structure of industries is biased towards capital-intensive enterprises, while owning a huge legacy of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that did poorly in creating employment. Regardless, the country has a favourable population structure for development. The youth employment rate is high, but the education and training system is \"unable to provide the skilled workers demanded by the expanding economy\" (p. 160). Those are issues that need to be dealt with by the government to avoid the middle-income trap. The background analysis for the achievement of Vietnam and its issues regarding employment creation is set out in the first part of the book. In the chapters on economic and human development performance, the book presents the success of Vietnam since 1990, where rapid economic growth has contributed to recognition of legitimacy and rights of private sectors and pro-trade reform. In addition, Vietnam's human development performance is presented through the improvement of UNDP's human development index (HDI), in achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs) and low inequality. Its employment performance is very good. Its unemployment rate is one of the lowest in Southeast Asia (p. 27). Beyond official statistics, however, the book rightly points to the weaknesses of the employment situation of Vietnam. The vulnerability of employment is high even with low unemployment rate as more than two-thirds of the employed population works with little or no pay for their family businesses. Youth unemployment accounted for 45 per cent of all unemployment and employment growth lagged behind population growth. Wage inequality is large between the two biggest cities, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh, and other regions, and between different business sectors. The quality of employment is questionable since employment is largely in the informal sector. On top of that, employment growth is lower than the growth in output, as estimated by various studies. \u2026\n\n==\n\nIrvin 1995:\n\nTitle: Vietnam: Assessing the achievements of Doi Moi\n\nAbstract: Following a decade of reform and the 1988\u201389 stabilisation programme, Vietnam appears well\u2010positioned to become a new East Asian \u2018dragon\u2019. Below, the main macroeconomic dimensions of the reform process are examined. In particular, improved terms of trade for food agriculture is seen as a key determinant of stabilisation; more generally, it is argued that the authorities have rightly given broad priority to macro\u2010stability over micro\u2010efficiency. While the process of institutional change is necessarily a lengthy one, rising domestic and foreign savings will help sustain rapid growth, mitigating any adverse distributional consequences of reform.

With the adoption of a new market-oriented policies, Viet Nam averaged an economic growth rate of 8 percent per year from 1990 to 2000, a growth rate accompanied by a large reduction in poverty, stemming from significant increases in school enrollment, and a rapid decrease in child malnutrition. The book uses an unusually rich set of macroeconomic, and household survey data, to examine several topics: the causes of the economic turnaround, and prospects for future growth; the impact of economic growth on household welfare, as measured by consumption expenditures, health, education, and other socioeconomic indicators; and, the nature of poverty in Viet Nam, and the effectiveness of government policies, intended to reduce same. Although the country's past achievements are impressive, future progress is by no means ensured.\n\n==\n\nKhoi 2018:\n\nTitle: An Empirical Analysis of Export-Led Growth of Vietnam: Trade in Value Added (TiVA) Approach\n\nAbstract: This paper examines the long-run relationship between domestic value added exports and economic growth of Vietnam using ARDL bounds test of cointegration on annual data covering the period of 1995-2014.The bounds test establishes existence of both short-run and long-run relationship between exports and GDP of Vietnam and shows a substantial contribution of exports in the real GDP (0.73 percent for one percent changes in the domestic value added exports). The exports pattern of Vietnam portrays it following the footsteps of export-led growth model of Mexico, whereby it has turned itself into export production platforms for MNCs by suppressing the wages, rather than developing own indigenous industrial capacity. In such scenario, it seems challenging for Vietnam to sustain its export-led growth which it has achieved so far based on its cheap labour. With the rising living standards, ultimately the comparative advantages of cheap labour force would vanish in the future, which will cause a wave of assembly jobs to flow out of Vietnam. Moreover, two other low-cost countries in the region, Cambodia and Myanmar are likely to rise as close competitors of Vietnam in the low-cost assembly works in the near future. By that time, in case Vietnam fails to enter into higher value added activities, it will drag itself into the \u2018middle income trap\u2019. Therefore, the \u2018assembly strategy\u2019 shall be bonded with strategy to develop own indigenous industrial capacity, and national technological base. These will help Vietnam to upgrade its activities along value chains in forms of product upgrading, process upgrading, functional upgrading, and sectoral upgrading so that it can switch its role of \u2018assembling agent\u2019 to \u2018indigenous producer\u2019.\n\n==\n\nNgoc 2008:\n\nTitle: Sources of Vietnam's economic growth\n\nAbstract: This article first estimates Cobb-Douglas production functions for Vietnam's economy using annual data in 1975\u20132003.

Similarly, Le (2008) attributes Vietnam's economic success to economic reforms and macroeconomic policies, which have helped stabilize the economy and attract foreign direct investment.\n\nFinancial development has also played a crucial role in Vietnam's economic growth. Anwar (2011) found a positive link between financial development and economic growth, with a high ratio of credit to Gross Provincial Product (GPP) accelerating economic growth. \n\nThe employment situation in Vietnam, as Lim (2014) points out, has both strengths and weaknesses. While the unemployment rate is low, the quality of employment is questionable due to a large informal sector and wage inequality.\n\nVietnam's economic reform process, known as Doi Moi, has been a key driver of the country's economic growth. Irvin (1995) argues that the reform process has positioned Vietnam to become a new East Asian 'dragon', indicating the potential for high economic growth. Glewwe (2004) supports this by noting that the reform process has led to high economic growth rates and a significant reduction in poverty.\n\nHowever, Khoi (2018) warns that Vietnam's export-led growth model, which relies heavily on cheap labor, may not be sustainable in the long term.

It is found that with increasing spreader width and emissivity, heat transfer performance increases.\n\n==\n\nGanesan 2018:\n\nTitle: Combined Effect of Mixed Convection and Surface Radiation Heat Transfer for Thermally Developing Flow in Vertical Channels\n\nAbstract: ABSTRACT Combined effect of laminar flow mixed convection and surface radiation heat transfer for thermally developing airflow in a vertical channel heated from a side has been experimentally examined with different thermal and geometric parameters. The channel boundary is made of two isothermal walls and two adiabatic walls, the isothermal parallel wall is heated uniformly and the opposite cold wall temperature is maintained equal to the inlet conditions. The heated wall temperature ranged from 55 to 100\u00b0C, Reynolds number ranged from 800 to 2900 and the heat flux was varied from 250 to 870 W/m2. To cover the wide range of Reynolds numbers, two aspect ratios of square and rectangular section were used. Surface radiation from the internal walls is considered through two emissivities i.e. 0.05 and 0.85, to represent weak and strong radiation effects, respectively. From the experiments, surface temperature and Nusselt number distributions of convection and radiation heat transfer are obtained for different heat flux values. Flow structure inside the channel is visualized to observe the flow pattern. The results show the combined effect of laminar flow mixed convection and surface radiation on the total heat transfer rate within the channel. The accumulating buoyancy force and airflow moves together vertically in the upward direction to give significant heat transfer enhancement in the vertical orientation of the channel.\n\n==\n\nRao 2002:\n\nTitle: Effect of surface radiation on conjugate mixed convection in a vertical channel with a discrete heat source in each wall\n\nAbstract: Abstract The results of a numerical analysis of the problem of two-dimensional, steady, incompressible, conjugate, laminar, mixed convection with surface radiation in a vertical parallel-plate channel, provided with a flush-mounted, heat generating, discrete heat source in each wall, are presented here. Air, a radiatively non-participating medium, is used as the cooling agent. A computer code based on the finite volume method is written exclusively for solving the above problem. The effect of surface emissivity, aspect ratio, discrete heat source position and modified Richardson number on the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics is explored. Useful correlations are evolved for the maximum temperature of the left and the right channel walls, the mean friction coefficient and the forced convection component of the mean friction coefficient.\n\n==\n\nYukio 1988:\n\nTitle: Combined radiation and free convection heat transfer in a vertical channel with arbitrary wall emissivities\n\nAbstract: Abstract Analytical and experimental studies of combined radiation and free convection heat transfer in a vertical channel in an absorbing and emitting medium are conducted. A channel consisting of parallel plates is heated asymmetrically, rendering both the wall and gas radiation important. A set of fundamental equations is established using the exponential wide-band model and the gray-gas model with arbitrary wall emissivities. Numerical results are compared with experimental ones. Wall emissivities are found to have a major effect on the combined heat transfer in this study. The gray-gas model is shown to fail to predict the negative net absorption in a gas layer next to an insulated wall.\n\n==\n\nTanda 2008:\n\nTitle: Natural convective heat transfer in vertical channels with low-thermal-conductivity ribs\n\nAbstract: Abstract The effect of repeated horizontal protrusions on the free-convection heat transfer in a vertical, asymmetrically heated, channel has been experimentally investigated. The protrusions have a square section and are made of a low-thermal-conductivity material. Experiments were conducted by varying the number of the protrusions over the heated surface (whose height was held fixed) and the aspect ratio of the channel. The convective fluid was air and the wall-to-ambient air temperature difference was set equal to 45\u00a0K. The local heat transfer coefficient was obtained by means of the schlieren optical technique. The protrusions were found to significantly alter the heat transfer distribution along the heated surface of the channel, especially in the vicinity of each obstacle. For the ranges of parameters studied, the addition of low-conductivity protrusions leads to a decrease in the average heat transfer coefficient, as compared to that for the smooth surface, in the 0\u20137% range for the largest channel aspect ratio and in the 18\u201343% for the smallest channel aspect ratio.\n\n==\n\nZhao 2018:\n\nTitle: Influence of channel scale on the convective heat transfer of CO2 at supercritical pressure in vertical tubes\n\nAbstract: Abstract Channel scales vary from several centimeters to several micrometers in various industrial applications that conduct convective heat transfer at supercritical pressures. The heat transfer performance reveals relatively different features even under similar Reynolds number and thermphysical property conditions. The authors investigated the influence of the channel scale on the supercritical convective heat transfer based on the experimental results conducted on vertical tubes with inner diameters of 0.27\u202fmm and 2.0\u202fmm. Numerical simulations using several low Reynolds number k-e turbulence models were also discussed to evaluate the performance of turbulence models when modelling supercritical heat transfer in tubes of various scales. The results exhibited significant heat transfer deterioration due to flow acceleration effect in the 0.27\u202fmm tube at a heat flux to mass flux ratio of about 0.2, whereas the 2.0\u202fmm tube at a similar inlet Reynolds number and heat flux to mass flux ratio exhibited great heat transfer enhancement due to the buoyancy effect. The heat transfer deterioration in the 0.27\u202fmm tube can be explained by its relation to the redistributed mean velocity profiles and the relatively small energy-containing scale while relatively large dissipation scale as compared to those in the 2.0\u202fmm tube.\n\n==\n\nTanda 1997:\n\nTitle: Natural convection heat transfer in vertical channels with and without transverse square ribs\n\nAbstract: Abstract Experiments were performed to determine heat transfer data for the natural convective flow of air in vertical channels with one surface roughened by transverse square ribs and the opposite surface smooth. Uniform wall temperature conditions were imposed on the ribbed side, while the smooth side remained unheated. Additional experiments were carried out in vertical channels without ribs, under the same channel geometry and thermal conditions. A schlieren optical technique was used to reconstruct the thermal field and to obtain distributions of heat transfer coefficients. The presence of ribs was found to alter heat transfer considerably, causing thermally inactive regions just upstream and downstream of each protrusion. Consequently, the heat transfer performance of the ribbed channel turned out to be lower than that of the corresponding smooth channel.\n\n==\n\nSahoo 1993:\n\nTitle: EFFECT OF AN OBSTRUCTION ON NATURAL CONVECTION HEAT TRANSFER IN VERTICAL CHANNELS\u2014A FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS\n\nAbstract: The effect of a rectangular obstruction of different sizes on natural convection heat transfer in the case of a vertical channel has been analysed for T boundary conditions on the walls. A comparison of the Nusselt number values with those for plane channel is presented. For smaller obstruction depths and for asymmetric heating, there is not much variation of the results from a case of channel with a baffle for asymmetric heating. For large obstruction depths, the flow conditions show a behaviour similar to that of a channel with a backward\u2010facing step.", "final_summary": "The research question at hand explores the intriguing interplay between surface emissivity and heat transfer in vertical channels. The findings from the collected papers provide a comprehensive understanding of this complex relationship.\n\nMandal (2020) found that an increase in emissivity and spreader width enhances heat transfer performance. This finding is echoed by Ganesan (2018), who observed that the combined effect of laminar flow mixed convection and surface radiation significantly enhances heat transfer in a vertical channel. The study also highlighted the role of surface emissivity in this process, with two different emissivities representing weak and strong radiation effects.\n\nRao (2002) further explored the impact of surface emissivity on heat transfer, along with other factors such as aspect ratio and discrete heat source position. The study found that these factors collectively influence the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics in a vertical channel. Similarly, Yukio (1988) found that wall emissivities have a major effect on combined heat transfer, emphasizing the importance of considering surface emissivity in heat transfer studies.\n\nHowever, not all studies found an enhancement in heat transfer with changes in surface emissivity. Tanda (2008) found that the addition of low-conductivity protrusions led to a decrease in the average heat transfer coefficient. This was also observed in Tanda's later study (1997), where the presence of ribs on one surface of the channel resulted in lower heat transfer performance compared to a smooth channel.\n\nZhao (2018) explored the influence of channel scale on convective heat transfer. While this study does not directly address surface emissivity, it provides valuable insights into other factors that can influence heat transfer in vertical channels. Sahoo (1993), on the other hand, focused on the effect of a rectangular obstruction on natural convection heat transfer in a vertical channel, providing further insights into the factors influencing heat transfer.\n\nIn conclusion, surface emissivity plays a significant role in heat transfer within vertical channels, with most studies indicating an enhancement in heat transfer with increased emissivity. However, other factors such as the presence of protrusions or ribs, the scale of the channel, and the presence of obstructions can also significantly influence heat transfer. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of heat transfer in vertical channels requires considering surface emissivity in conjunction with these other factors."}, {"query": "Releavance of Open science to sustainable development and international cooperation", "paper_list_string": "Drach 2022:\n\nTitle: Global cooperation in Open Science policies and procedures to ensure the sustainable development of society\n\nAbstract: One of the important mechanisms of world transformation in the context of the formation of sustainable development of society is the achievement and provision of innovative, inclusive, fair and high-quality models of development and institutionalization of science.

FFT is a short-term intervention for delinquents and status offenders, along with their parents. The study sample consists of 120 cases: 70 youth and parents who were mandated by the Family Court to participate in FFT and 50 youth and their parents who were referred to FFT by other agencies. The sample is diverse in terms of gender, race and ethnicity. The outcome variables consist of a set of scales obtained from the Strengths and Needs Assessment (SNA). Changes in life domain functioning, child strengths, acculturation, caregivers' strengths, caregivers' needs, child behavioral emotional needs, and child risk behaviors are assessed. The analysis indicates that both groups improved across all domains. Overall, being mandated to participate in FFT does not predict greater improvements in outcomes. The findings suggest that status offenders and minor delinquents who participated in FFT could be processed less formally without foregoing the therapy outcomes.\n\n==\n\nUngar 2017:\n\nTitle: Rules or No Rules? Three Strategies for Engagement with Young People in Mandated Services\n\nAbstract: A qualitative study of 61 youth receiving mandated services (child welfare, mental health, probation) or services where there were no alternatives (residential care for homeless youth) explored worker-client relationships from the perspective of young people themselves. Findings suggest three different but related roles played by workers that successfully engage adolescent clients: (1) \u201cInformal supporters\u201d de-professionalize their role and flatten hierarchies, emphasizing empathy and enforcing few rules; (2) \u201cAdministrators\u201d enforce rules that are in the child\u2019s best interest but do so with little emotional engagement; and (3) \u201cCaregivers\u201d who hold reasonable expectations and impose structures but are flexible in their negotiations with youth when rules were broken. While youth spoke most positively about their workers when they acted as informal supporters, a deeper analysis of the data showed that youth also engaged well with workers who enforced rules when those rules were necessary for the child\u2019s safety, applied flexibly, age-appropriate, and fit with cultural norms. Use of all three approaches to youth engagement may help workers create better therapeutic relationships with youth receiving mandated services.\n\n==\n\nYeterian 2013:\n\nTitle: Does Mandated Treatment Benefit Youth? A Prospective Investigation of Adolescent Justice System Involvement, Treatment Motivation, and Substance Use Outcomes\n\nAbstract: The majority of adolescents treated for substance use disorder in the United States are now referred by the criminal justice system. Little is known, however, regarding how justice-system involvement relates to adolescent community treatment outcomes. Controversy exists, also, over the extent to which justice system involvement reflects a lack of intrinsic motivation for treatment. This study examined the relation between justice system referral and reported reason for treatment entry and tested the extent to which each predicted treatment response and outcome. Adolescent outpatients (N = 127; M age = 16.7, 24% female) with varying levels of justice-system involvement (i.e., no justice system involvement [No-JSI, n = 63], justice-system involved [JSI, n = 40], justice system involved-mandated [JSI-M, n = 24]) and motivation levels (i.e., self-motivated, n = 40, externally-motivated, n = 87) were compared at treatment intake. Multilevel mixed models tested these groups' effects on percent days abstinent (PDA) and odds of heavy drinking (HD) over 12 months. JSI-M were less likely to be self-motivated compared to No-JSI or JSI (p = .009). JSI-M had higher PDA overall, but with significant declines over time, relative to no-JSI. Self-motivated patients did not differ from externally motivated patients on PDA or HD mandated adolescent outpatients were substantially less likely to report self-motivated treatment entry. Despite the notion that self-motivated treatment entry would be likely to produce better outcomes, a judicial mandate appears to predict an initially stronger treatment response, although this diminishes over time. Ongoing monitoring and/or treatment may be necessary to help maintain treatment gains for justice system-involved adolescents.\n\n==\n\nHuang 2011:\n\nTitle: Youth engagement and service dosage in a mandated setting: A study of residential treatment centers\n\nAbstract: Treatment theory in residential treatment centers (RTCs) is conceived as a two-stage process of first engaging the client and then delivering services or interventions aimed at presenting problems. This treatment logic has been criticized for \"creaming clients\" or reserving services for clients easier to engage or more amenable to treatment but less in need. The present study examines whether higher early levels of engagement by youth in RTCs leads to more intervention and compares the relative effects of engagement and seriousness of presenting problems on the quantity of services provided by the mid-point in the adolescents' stay. Data come from interviews with a clinical sample of 71 male and 59 female adolescents in two RTCs in an eastern state. Findings indicate that higher level of engagement predicts more treatment interventions. Treatment staff delivered higher dosages of services to youth with more current behavioral problems, not those with problematic behaviors at intake. Youth with positive peer group backgrounds also received more services. Findings extend knowledge of how treatment staff provide treatment to clients and the role engagement plays in RTC service delivery.\n\n==\n\nB\u00fcttner 2011:\n\nTitle: [Youth welfare and therapy: effects of youth welfare alone and youth welfare combined with additional therapy].\n\nAbstract: Around 17% of children and adolescents suffer from some form of psychological disorder. Compared to this rate, the prevalence among families seeking youth welfare assistance is substantially higher: 60 to 80% of children in day care and residential educational settings meet the criteria of an ICD-10-diagnosis. While effective psychotherapeutic interventions are available, only a fraction of those children affected receive such help. This study assesses whether the effectiveness of educational day care support can be increased by offering additional treatment. To this end, 89 families were assessed who received an average of two years of day care assistance. One group (n = 23) received additional therapeutic treatment. In order to assess the effectiveness of combined youth welfare and therapeutic intervention, indicative problem areas were evaluated using a pre-post-design. Effect measures indicate small advantages of the combined treatment. The group receiving additional therapeutic treatment suffered from fewer risk factors. They also showed some long term effects and fewer families needed follow-up support. Overall, combined treatment was more effective. However, differences between the two groups were less pronounced than expected, due to the effectiveness of day care groups.\n\n==\n\nNijhof 2012:\n\nTitle: The Associations between Structural Treatment Characteristics and Post-Treatment Functioning in Compulsory Residential Youth Care\n\nAbstract: BackgroundIn 2005 a new compulsory residential treatment program was developed for adolescents in need for protection against themselves or their environment.ObjectiveThe aim of the present study was to examine the association of structural treatment characteristics of this new residential treatment program (i.e., duration of treatment, discharge status, and group composition in terms of sex) with post-treatment functioning. Additionally, the number of pre-treatment risk factors was included in the model.MethodA total of 301 adolescents (174 boys, 127 girls), with a mean age at time of admittance of 15.50 (SD\u00a0=\u00a01.26) participated in this study. The number of risk factors was derived from treatment files of the adolescents at time of entrance. Six months after discharge, adolescents participated in a telephone interview to measure ten post-treatment variables indicating how well they were doing.ResultsThe results showed that duration of treatment was related to post-treatment living situation, in that adolescents who were in treatment for shorter durations were more likely to live on their own after treatment. For discharge status, findings suggested that adolescents who were regularly discharged had more frequent contact with their family; however, they also showed higher alcohol consumption 6\u00a0months after treatment. Group composition was related to the girls\u2019 official offending, indicating that girls placed in mixed-sex groups showed significantly fewer official police contacts than did girls in girls-only treatment groups.ConclusionOverall, structural treatment characteristics were hardly related to the adolescents\u2019 functioning after treatment.

The literature on the extent and correlates of this problem is still emerging. The present study aims to fill part of this gap by examining the association between baseline psychosocial risk and protective factors on engagement in substance use behavior over a period of 36 months for child welfare involved youth. It further compares substance use behavior between youth placed in out-of-home care and those who remained with their biological families. Data come from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW), a national probability study of children and adolescents undergoing investigation for abuse or neglect. The sample for this analysis was restricted to 827 youth who were 11 years or older at baseline data collection. Key findings include a high rate of social substance use (47.7%) and illicit substance use (17.4%). There was a limited role of protective factors in mitigating risk behavior for social substance use (caregiver connectedness; OR=0.51, p<0.05). Avoiding foster care placement was a protective factor for illicit substance use (OR=0.43, p<0.05). Delinquency was a risk factor associated with both social substance use (OR=1.06, p<0.01) and hard substance use (OR=1.10, p<0.001). Given the high prevalence of substance use among child welfare involved youth, prevention efforts for this population require a better understanding of biological, psychological, and social protective factors. The child welfare system is an untapped resource that has the potential to be a gateway to and a platform for substance abuse prevention services that should be incorporated into child welfare safety and permanency interventions.\n\n==\n\nHamilton 2011:\n\nTitle: Psychological Distress, Service Utilization, and Prescribed Medications among Youth with and without Histories of Involvement with Child Protective Services\n\nAbstract: The objective of this study was to examine differences in psychological distress, service utilization, and prescriptions for medications between adolescents with histories of family involvement with child protective services (CPS) and adolescents without such involvement. Data on 3,497 students were obtained from the 2009 cycle of the Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey, a province-wide school-based survey of 7th to 12th graders. All analyses adjusted for the complex sample design. Results indicated that individuals who reported histories of family involvement with CPS were more likely to report elevated risk of psychological distress, had a greater number of visits to doctors and other professionals for mental health concerns, and were more likely to have been prescribed medications for depression or anxiety than individuals with no involvement with CPS. These results suggest a need for greater research on service utilization and prescription medications among individuals with histories of family involvement with CPS.", "final_summary": "The effects of mandatory therapy on youth participation in child protective services are multifaceted and complex.

This suggests that a combined approach may be more effective than mandatory therapy alone.\n\nNijhof (2012) found that structural treatment characteristics, such as duration of treatment and discharge status, were hardly related to adolescents' functioning after treatment. This suggests that other factors, such as the quality of the therapeutic relationship, may be more important in determining outcomes.\n\nTraube (2012) found a high prevalence of substance use among child welfare-involved youth and suggested that the child welfare system could be a platform for substance abuse prevention services.

This is achieved by either treatment with CNBr or UV irradiation, respectively. These disassembly mechanisms could be the starting point for methodology that allows further manipulation of self\u2010assembled peptide amphiphile architectures.

Peptides with a palmitic acid alkylchain were designed and characterized to study the effect of the structure modifications on self-assembling capabilities and the multiple binding capacity to hemagglutinin (HA), the surface protein of influenza virus type A. The peptide amphiphiles consists of a hydrophilic headgroup with a biological functionality of the peptide sequence and a chemically conjugated hydrophobic tail. In solution they self-assemble easily to micelles with a hydrophobic core surrounded by a closely packed peptide-shell.ResultsIn this study the effect of a multiple peptide binding partner to the receptor binding site of HA could be determined with surface plasmon resonance measurements. The applied modification of the peptides causes signal amplification in relationship to the unmodified peptide wherein the high constant specificity persists. The molecular assembly of the peptides was characterized by the determination of critical micelle concentration (CMC) with concentration of 10-5 M and the colloidal size distribution.ConclusionThe modification of the physico-chemical parameters by producing peptide amphiphiles form monomeric structures which enhances the binding affinity and allows a better examination of the interaction with the virus surface protein hemagglutinin.\n\n==\n\nLin 2011:\n\nTitle: De novo design of bioactive protein-resembling nanospheres via dendrimer-templated peptide amphiphile assembly.\n\nAbstract: Self-assembling peptide amphiphiles (PAs) have been extensively used in the development of novel biomaterials. Because of their propensity to form cylindrical micelles, their use is limited in applications where small spherical micelles are desired. Here we present a platform method for controlling the self-assembly of biofunctional PAs into spherical 50 nm particles using dendrimers as shape-directing scaffolds. This templating approach results in biocompatible, stable protein-like assemblies displaying peptides with native secondary structure and biofunctionality.\n\n==\n\nBitton 2005:\n\nTitle: Self-assembly of model DNA-binding peptide amphiphiles.\n\nAbstract: Peptide amphiphiles combine the specific functionality of proteins with the engineering convenience of synthetic amphiphiles. These molecules covalently link a peptide headgroup, typically from an active fragment of a larger protein, to a hydrophobic alkyl tail. Our research is aimed at forming and characterizing covalently stabilized, self-assembled, peptide-amphiphile aggregates that can be used as a platform for the examination and modular design and construction of systems with engineering biological activity. We have studied the self-assembly properties of a model DNA-binding amphiphile, having a GCN4 peptide as the headgroup and containing a polymerizable methacrylic group in the tail region, using a combination of small-angle X-ray scattering, small-angle neutron scattering, and cryo- transmission electron microscopy. Our results reveal a variety of morphologies in this system. The peptide amphiphiles assembled in aqueous solution to helical ribbons and tubules. These structures transformed into lamella upon DNA binding. In contrast with common surfactants, the specific interaction between the headgroups seems to play an important role in determining the microstructure. The geometry of the self-assembled aggregate can be controlled by means of adding a cosurfactant. For example, the addition of SDS induced the formation of spherical micelles.\n\n==\n\nXu 2010:\n\nTitle: Self-assembly behavior of peptide amphiphiles (PAs) with different length of hydrophobic alkyl tails.\n\nAbstract: Amphiphilic peptide and their derivatives, with distinguished advantages over conventional materials, have received extensively research interesting recently. In this work, four peptide amphiphiles (PAs1-4) with different length of hydrophobic alkyl tails (C9 for PA1, C11 for PA2, C13 for PA3, and C15 for PA4) were fabricated and their self-assembly behaviors in aqueous medium at different pHs were investigated systematically. It was found that all the peptide amphiphiles can self-assemble in water at a neutral pH of 7 to form tightly packed nanofibers with a beta-sheet conformation. When altering the solution environment to basic medium (pH 11), due to the strong hydrophobic interaction of long alkyl tails in PA3 and PA4, the fibrous nanostructure self-assembled from PA3 and PA4 was not destroyed. However, the nanofibers self-assembled from PA1 in which the length of alkyl tail was relatively short converted into loose spherical micelles with a beta-sheet conformation. Due to the moderate length of alkyl tail in PA2, both nanofibers and micelles can be formed via the self-assembly of PA2 when increasing the pH of the self-assembling system.\n\n==\n\nHendricks 2017:\n\nTitle: Supramolecular Assembly of Peptide Amphiphiles\n\nAbstract: Conspectus Peptide amphiphiles (PAs) are small molecules that contain hydrophobic components covalently conjugated to peptides. In this Account, we describe recent advances involving PAs that consist of a short peptide sequence linked to an aliphatic tail. The peptide sequence can be designed to form \u03b2-sheets among the amino acids near the alkyl tail, while the residues farthest from the tail are charged to promote solubility and in some cases contain a bioactive sequence. In water, \u03b2-sheet formation and hydrophobic collapse of the aliphatic tails induce assembly of the molecules into supramolecular one-dimensional nanostructures, commonly high-aspect-ratio cylindrical or ribbonlike nanofibers. These nanostructures hold significant promise for biomedical functions due to their ability to display a high density of biological signals on their surface for targeting or to activate pathways, as well as for biocompatibility and biodegradable nature. Recent studies have shown that supramolecular systems, such as PAs, often become kinetically trapped in local minima along their self-assembly reaction coordinate, not unlike the pathways associated with protein folding. Furthermore, the assembly pathway can influence the shape, internal structure, and dimension of nanostructures and thereby affect their bioactivity. We discuss methods to map the energy landscape of a PA structure as a function of thermal energy and ionic strength and vary these parameters to convert between kinetically trapped and thermodynamically favorable states. We also demonstrate that the pathway-dependent morphology of the PA assembly can determine biological cell adhesion and survival rates. The dynamics associated with the nanostructures are also critical to their function, and techniques are now available to probe the internal dynamics of these nanostructures. For example, by conjugating radical electron spin labels to PAs, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used to study the rotational diffusion rates within the fiber, showing a liquidlike to solidlike transition through the cross section of the nanofiber. PAs can also be labeled with fluorescent dyes, allowing the use of super-resolution microscopy techniques to study the molecular exchange dynamics between PA fibers. For a weak hydrogen-bonding PA, individual PA molecules or clusters exchange between fibers in time scales as short as minutes. The amount of hydrogen bonding within PAs that dictates the dynamics also plays an important role in biological function. In one case, weak hydrogen bonding within a PA resulted in cell death through disruption of lipid membranes, while in another example reduced hydrogen bonding enhanced growth factor signaling by increasing lipid raft mobility. PAs are a promising platform for designing advanced hybrid materials. We discuss a covalent polymer with a rigid aromatic imine backbone and alkylated peptide side chains that simultaneously polymerizes and interacts with a supramolecular PA structure with identical chemistry to that of the side chains. The covalent polymerization can be \u201ccatalyzed\u201d by noncovalent polymerization of supramolecular monomers, taking advantage of the dynamic nature of supramolecular assemblies. These novel hybrid structures have potential in self-repairing materials and as reusable scaffolds for delivery of drugs or other chemicals. Finally, we highlight recent biomedical applications of PAs and related structures, ranging from bone regeneration to decreasing blood loss during internal bleeding.", "final_summary": "Peptide amphiphiles (PAs) are intriguing molecules that merge the specific functionality of proteins with the engineering convenience of synthetic amphiphiles.

We assessed the extent to which low and middle-income countries (LMIC) have included cost-saving interventions in their national strategic health plans. Methods We used the Tufts Medical Center Global Health Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, an open-source database of English-language cost-per-disability-adjusted life year (DALY) studies, to identify analyses published in the last 10 years (2008\u20132017) of cost-saving health interventions in LMICs. To assess whether countries prioritised cost-saving interventions within their latest national health strategic plans, we identified 10 countries, all in sub-Saharan Africa, with the highest measures on the global burden of disease scale and reviewed their national health priority plans. Results We identified 392 studies (63%) targeting LMICs that reported 3315 cost-per-DALY ratios, of which 207 ratios (6%) represented interventions reported to be cost saving. Over half (53%) of these targeted sub-Saharan Africa. For the 10 countries we investigated in sub-Saharan Africa, 58% (79/137) of cost-saving interventions correspond with priorities identified in country plans. Alignment ranged from 95% (21/22 prioritised cost-saving ratios) in South Africa to 17% (2/12 prioritised cost-saving ratios) in Cameroon. Human papillomavirus vaccination was a noted priority in 70% (7/10) of national health prioritisation plans, while 40% (4/10) of countries explicitly included prenatal serological screening for syphilis. HIV prevention and treatment were stated priorities in most country health plans, whereas 40% (2/5) of countries principally outlined efforts for lymphatic filariasis. From our sample of 45 unique interventions, 36% of interventions (16/45) included costs associated directly with the implementation of the intervention. Conclusion Our findings indicate substantial variation across country and disease area in incorporating economic evidence into national health priority plans in a sample of sub-Saharan African countries. To make health economic data more salient, the authors of cost-effectiveness analyses must do more to reflect implementation costs and other factors that could limit healthcare delivery.\n\n==\n\nGaziano 2013:\n\nTitle: Scaling up chronic disease prevention interventions in lower- and middle-income countries.\n\nAbstract: Chronic diseases are increasingly becoming a health burden in lower- and middle-income countries, putting pressure on public health efforts to scale up interventions. This article reviews current efforts in interventions on a population and individual level. Population-level interventions include ongoing efforts to reduce smoking rates, reduce intake of salt and trans-fatty acids, and increase physical activity in increasingly sedentary populations. Individual-level interventions include control and treatment of risk factors for chronic diseases and secondary prevention. This review also discusses the barriers in interventions, particularly those specific to low- and middle-income countries.

Previous comprehensive rankings for low- and middle- income countries were undertaken in 2005 and 2006, accompanying the development of strategies for the Millennium Development Goals. We update the rankings using studies published since 2000, as strategies are being considered for the Sustainable Development Goals. Methods Expert systematic searches of the literature were undertaken for a broad range of health interventions. Cost-effectiveness results using Disability Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) as the health outcome were standardized to 2012 US dollars. Results 149 individual studies of 93 interventions qualified for inclusion. Interventions for Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health accounted for 37% of interventions, and major infectious diseases (AIDS, TB, malaria and neglected tropical diseases) for 24%, consistent with the priorities of the Millennium Development Goals. More than half of the interventions considered cost less than $200 per DALY and hence can be considered for inclusion in Universal Health Care packages even in low-income countries. Discussion Important changes have occurred in rankings since 2006. Priorities have changed as a result of new technologies, new methods for changing behavior, and significant price changes for some vaccines and drugs. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require LMICs to study a broader range of health interventions, particularly in adult health. Some interventions are no longer studied, in some cases because they have become usual care, in other cases because they are no longer relevant. Updating cost-effectiveness rankings on a regular basis is potentially a valuable exercise.\n\n==\n\nLewin 2008:\n\nTitle: Supporting the delivery of cost-effective interventions in primary health-care systems in low-income and middle-income countries: an overview of systematic reviews\n\nAbstract: Strengthening health systems is a key challenge to improving the delivery of cost-effective interventions in primary health care and achieving the vision of the Alma-Ata Declaration. Effective governance, financial and delivery arrangements within health systems, and effective implementation strategies are needed urgently in low-income and middle-income countries. This overview summarises the evidence from systematic reviews of health systems arrangements and implementation strategies, with a particular focus on evidence relevant to primary health care in such settings. Although evidence is sparse, there are several promising health systems arrangements and implementation strategies for strengthening primary health care. However, their introduction must be accompanied by rigorous evaluations. The evidence base needs urgently to be strengthened, synthesised, and taken into account in policy and practice, particularly for the benefit of those who have been excluded from the health care advances of recent decades.\n\n==\n\nJeet 2018:\n\nTitle: Effectiveness of targeting the health promotion settings for non-communicable disease control in low/middle-income countries: systematic review protocol\n\nAbstract: Introduction Settings-based approaches to health promotion, involving holistic and multidisciplinary methods, which integrate action across risk factors are important. Major advantage of focusing on these settings is the continuous and intensive contact with the participant. Despite the apparent advantages of addressing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) using targeted interventions for several developed country settings, a relative lack of evidence of effectiveness of such interventions in low/middle-income countries has led to poor allocation of resources towards these interventions. The focus is therefore on the settings rather than any one condition, and we therefore expect the findings to generalise to NCD prevention and control efforts. We intend to estimate the effectiveness of targeted interventions in low/middle-income countries. Methods and analysis We will search PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, OVID, WHO Library and The Cochrane Library from the year 2000 to March 2018 without language restrictions. Study designs to be included will be randomised controlled trials. The primary outcome of effectiveness will be the percentage change in population having different behavioural risk factors. Subgroup analyses will be performed, and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. Ethics and dissemination No ethical issues are foreseen. The Institute Ethics Committee of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research approved the doctoral research protocol under which this review is being done. Dissemination will be done by submitting scientific articles to academic peer-reviewed journals. We will present the results at relevant conferences and meetings. Study design Systematic review.

Furthermore, HIV/AIDS is increasingly becoming a chronic disorder. An integrated approach to the management of chronic diseases, irrespective of cause, is needed in primary health care. Management of chronic diseases is fundamentally different from acute care, relying on several features: opportunistic case finding for assessment of risk factors, detection of early disease, and identification of high risk status; a combination of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions, often in a stepped-care fashion; and long-term follow-up with regular monitoring and promotion of adherence to treatment. To meet the challenge of chronic diseases, primary health care will have to be strengthened substantially. In the many countries with shortages of primary-care doctors, non-physician clinicians will have a leading role in preventing and managing chronic diseases, and these personnel need appropriate training and continuous quality assurance mechanisms. More evidence is needed about the cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies in primary health care. Research on scaling-up should be embedded in large-scale delivery programmes for chronic diseases with a strong emphasis on assessment.\n\n==\n\nCecchini 2010:\n\nTitle: Tackling of unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and obesity: health effects and cost-effectiveness\n\nAbstract: The obesity epidemic is spreading to low-income and middle-income countries as a result of new dietary habits and sedentary ways of life, fuelling chronic diseases and premature mortality. In this report we present an assessment of public health strategies designed to tackle behavioural risk factors for chronic diseases that are closely linked with obesity, including aspects of diet and physical inactivity, in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa. England was included for comparative purposes. Several population-based prevention policies can be expected to generate substantial health gains while entirely or largely paying for themselves through future reductions of health-care expenditures. These strategies include health information and communication strategies that improve population awareness about the benefits of healthy eating and physical activity; fiscal measures that increase the price of unhealthy food content or reduce the cost of healthy foods rich in fibre; and regulatory measures that improve nutritional information or restrict the marketing of unhealthy foods to children. A package of measures for the prevention of chronic diseases would deliver substantial health gains, with a very favourable cost-effectiveness profile.\n\n==\n\nStokols 1996:\n\nTitle: The Social Ecology of Health Promotion: Implications for Research and Practice\n\nAbstract: Recent studies have documented the substantial health benefits and financial savings associated with many disease prevention and health promotion programs. ~5 Examples of effective strategies include employee health risk appraisal, counseling, and lifestyle change programs,6,r cultural change strategies within organizational settings, 8,9 and the provision of clinical preventive services to enhance maternal and child health? \u00b0,11 A mid-decade appraisal of progress toward meeting the Healthy People 2000 goals in the United States found substantial reductions in adult use of tobacco products and in alcohol-related automobile deaths and moderate gains in the proportion of adults exercising regularly and eating less fatty diets. Also noted was an increase in the proportion of workplaces providing health promotion programs for their employees. 12.13 Despite these encouraging trends, not all health promotion efforts have been met with unqualified success. Even the best-designed worksite health promotion programs reach only a small proportion of the total worktbrce. Participants in these programs tend to be healthier, better paid, more educated, and more motivated to change their health habits than nonparticipants.~.2Also, lifestyle-change programs that proceed in a \"linear\" fashion to modify specific health behaviors often neglect the contextual circumstances that lead to high relapse and attrition rates once the interventions have ended.14,15 And certain health risks--such as exposure to community violence, obesity, teen pregnancy, substance abuse, financial barriers to medical and preventive services, and lack of adequate health insurance-remain \"segmented in pockets of heightened prevalence, \u2019\u201916 particularly among low-income and minority groups in the population. 4,12,~v,~s To improve the health of vulnerable populations, and to reduce the self-selection biases and attrition rates associated with many intervention", "final_summary": "The cost-effectiveness of health promotion interventions in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) is a critical area of research, given the finite resources and the increasing burden of chronic diseases in these regions. \n\nLeech (2020) found that there is substantial variation across countries and disease areas in incorporating economic evidence into national health priority plans.

Findings - The two major findings are that: technological progress was statistically absent in the growth of the Vietnamese economy throughout the period studied; and the most important source of economic growth is capital accumulation, accounting for between 84 percent and 89 percent of Vietnamese economic growth throughout the period 1975-2005, and between 85 percent and 90 percent in the reform period (1986-2005). Originality/value - This paper is the first of its kind in the Vietnamese literature that successfully sheds light on, among other things, the roles of capital and technological progress in the Vietnamese economy during the period 1975-2005. It also makes clear that Vietnam's economic growth has been fueled mainly by foreign funds and, thus, the continued heavy reliance of the economy on this financial source will make its growth unsustainable.

This paper finds significant contributions of world trade, and competitiveness and liberalization effects to Vietnam's export growth over the period 1997\u20132008. Vietnam's exports became more competitive and better complemented the import demand of Vietnam's trade partners. In addition, dynamic comparative advantage became evident in many products, but significant room remains for improving export competitiveness. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows also increased and helped stimulate Vietnam's exports. FDI inflows have increased in both the short\u2010 and long\u2010term, yet are only of a limited magnitude. This necessitates more effective measures to enhance the linkages between FDI and domestic enterprises.\n\n==\n\nPincus 2009:\n\nTitle: Vietnam: Sustaining Growth in Difficult Times\n\nAbstract: Vietnam has achieved high rates of economic growth for a period of two decades. Growth slowed in 2008 as the government was forced to tighten credit in order to slow down price inflation. With the advent of the global recession, the government must now reverse course and find ways to support demand in the face of declining exports and foreign investment. However, as a small, open economy with a fixed exchange rate and large fiscal and trade deficits, Vietnam's options are limited. The most effective response would be to gradually depreciate the Vietnamese dong to slow the flood of imports and boost export prospects, while redirecting the public investment towards labour rather than import-intensive projects. The government must also find ways to impose discipline on the large state-owned enterprises and control their diversification into financial sector activities.\n\n==\n\nJenkins 2004:\n\nTitle: Vietnam in the global economy: trade, employment and poverty\n\nAbstract: Vietnam has undergone a significant change from a relatively closed economy as a result of the reform process initiated in the late 1980s. This has been accompanied by rapid economic growth and substantial poverty reduction during the 1990s. Since one of the main mechanisms through which greater openness is expected to lead to poverty reduction is via the labour market, the paper examines the impact which trade flows have had on employment in Vietnam since the early 1990s. Using a variety of different methods, the paper shows that the growth of exports has had a significant positive effect on employment, while increased import competition had a negative effect both directly and indirectly through rationalization of producers facing foreign competition.

Recent work describing neuronal parallels between spatial and non-spatial behaviours has rekindled the notion of a systematic organisation of knowledge across multiple domains. We review experimental evidence and theoretical frameworks that point to principles unifying these apparently disparate functions. These principles describe how to learn and use abstract, generalisable knowledge and suggest map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organising knowledge of all kinds.

Organizing Knowledge for Flexible Behavior\n\nAbstract: It is proposed that a cognitive map encoding the relationships between entities in the world supports flexible behavior, but the majority of the neural evidence for such a system comes from studies of spatial navigation. Recent work describing neuronal parallels between spatial and non-spatial behaviors has rekindled the notion of a systematic organization of knowledge across multiple domains. We review experimental evidence and theoretical frameworks that point to principles unifying these apparently disparate functions. These principles describe how to learn and use abstract, generalizable knowledge and suggest that map-like representations observed in a spatial context may be an instance of general coding mechanisms capable of organizing knowledge of all kinds. We highlight how artificial agents endowed with such principles exhibit flexible behavior and learn map-like representations observed in the brain. Finally, we speculate on how these principles may offer insight into the extreme generalizations, abstractions, and inferences that characterize human cognition.\n\n==\n\nSchmajuk 1998:\n\nTitle: Cognitive maps\n\nAbstract: The term, \" cognitive map, \" has various meanings. Some limit it to representations of the physical or spatial. Others restrict it to social matters. We use the term broadly to stand for what the idea of a \" theory \" \u2014a Principled Developmental-stage notion\u2014develops into at the Perspectivist Developmental-stage. The comparison between theory and cognitive map is explained below under the heading, \" Cognitive Maps and Developmental Stages. \" The word \" cognitive \" means \" related to knowing, thinking, or inquiry. \" Therefore \" cognitive maps \" are literally just \" thinking maps \" or mental or conceptual models. They are, metaphorically, analogous to geographic maps, but of cognitive \" territory \" instead of geographical territory. Geographic maps display the location of geographic features: mountains, valleys, rivers, lakes, and so on. They also show the spatial relationships among them: a river rising in the mountains and flowing into a lake, for example. Such maps reveal the lay of the land and enable you to locate where you are, where you want to go, and how to get there. They are useful for making a journey or for finding your way around. Of course, there are many other kinds of maps besides geographic ones: maps of population, economics, weather, and others. Cognitive maps are more abstract, but perform similar functions for concepts.\n\n==\n\nYeap 1988:\n\nTitle: Towards a Computational Theory of Cognitive Maps\n\nAbstract: Abstract A computational theory of cognitive maps is developed which can explain some of the current findings about cognitive maps in the psychological literature and which provides a coherent framework for future development. The theory is tested with several computer implementations which demonstrate how the shape of the environment is computed and how one's conceptual representation of the environment is derived. We begin with the idea that the cognitive mapping process should be studied as two loosely coupled modules: The first module, known as the raw cognitive map, is computed from information made explicit in Marr's 2 1 2 -D sketch and not from high-level descriptions of what we perceive. The second module, known as the full cognitive map, takes the raw cognitive map as input and produces different \u201cabstract representations\u201d for solving high-level spatial tasks faced by the individual.\n\n==\n\nImani 2012:\n\nTitle: Recreating mental image with the aid of cognitive maps and its role in environmental perception\n\nAbstract: Abstract People have some kind of internal model of a geographical space. This research is concerned with aspects of environmental cognition; that is our ability to imagine about our spatial world. In particular, this study makes an attempt to describe cognitive maps and the individual differences between people's map. Data was gathered from a sample of fifty persons. All of them walked through a historical region in Isfahan and were asked to draw a sketch map; the map was then assessed. The major finding was that our spatial knowledge is \u201cmap-like\u201d rather than, say, a sequence of instructions for various routes.\n\n==\n\nEpstein 2017:\n\nTitle: The cognitive map in humans: spatial navigation and beyond\n\nAbstract: The 'cognitive map' hypothesis proposes that brain builds a unified representation of the spatial environment to support memory and guide future action. Forty years of electrophysiological research in rodents suggest that cognitive maps are neurally instantiated by place, grid, border and head direction cells in the hippocampal formation and related structures. Here we review recent work that suggests a similar functional organization in the human brain and yields insights into how cognitive maps are used during spatial navigation. Specifically, these studies indicate that (i) the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex support map-like spatial codes, (ii) posterior brain regions such as parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices provide critical inputs that allow cognitive maps to be anchored to fixed environmental landmarks, and (iii) hippocampal and entorhinal spatial codes are used in conjunction with frontal lobe mechanisms to plan routes during navigation. We also discuss how these three basic elements of cognitive map based navigation\u2014spatial coding, landmark anchoring and route planning\u2014might be applied to nonspatial domains to provide the building blocks for many core elements of human thought.\n\n==\n\nPortugali 1996:\n\nTitle: The construction of cognitive maps\n\nAbstract: The Construction of Cognitive Maps: An Introduction J.

The learning of city locations was considered in two studies. One study focused on the learning of city locations on four continents. Results indicated the neural network aligned the cities producing systematic errors similar to those in human cognitive maps. A second study had a neural network learn a biased sample of city locations in the United States. Results indicated a non-linear relationship between cognitive and physical distances.

This tertius iungens (or \u201cthird who joins\u201d) strategic orientation, contrasts with the tertius gaudens orientation emphasized in structural holes theory, which concerns the advantage of a broker who can play people off against one another for his or her own benefit. Results of a multimethod study of networks and innovation in an engineering division of an automotive manufacturer show that a tertius iungens orientation, dense social networks, and diverse social knowledge predict involvement in innovation.

But no one has examined the aggregate consequences of the link from spatial layout, to social networks, to innovation. This project enriches our understanding of how innovation works especially in highly innovative organizations by exploring the social dimensions of innovation as they are embedded in a specific spatial milieu. Workspace layout generates spatial boundaries that divide and reunite built space. These boundaries create relations of accessibility and visibility that integrate or segregate behaviors, activities, and people. As built space structures patterns of circulation, copresence, coawareness, and encounter in an organization, these interrelationships become fundamental to the development of social networks, especially those networks critical to the innovation process. This article presents a review of the knowledge bases of social network and spatial layout theories, and reports on a preliminary study of the effects of spatial layout on the formation and maintenance of social network structure and the support of innovation.\n\n==\n\nMuller 2019:\n\nTitle: The effect of social networks structure on innovation performance: A review and directions for research\n\nAbstract: Abstract Research on growth of innovations introduced to the market has gradually shifted its focus from aggregate-level diffusion to exploring how growth is influenced by a given social network structure's characteristics. In this paper, we critically review this branch of literature. We argue that the growth of an innovation in a social network is shaped by the network's structure. Borrowing from the field of industrial organization in economics, which defines itself as the study of the effect of market structure on market performance, we describe this new wave of research on growth of innovations as the effect of social network structure on innovation performance . Hence, social network structural characteristics should be incorporated into research on new product growth as well as into managerial marketing decisions such as targeting and new product seeding. We review how social network structure influences innovations' market performance. Specifically, we discuss (1) a networks' global characteristics, namely average degree, degree distribution, clustering, and degree assortativity; (2) dyadic characteristics, or the relationships between pairs of network members, namely tie strength and embeddedness; (3) intrinsic individual characteristics, namely opinion leadership and susceptibility; and (4) location-based individual characteristics, namely the degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality of an individual network member. Overall, we find that growth is particularly effective in networks that demonstrate the \u201c3 Cs\u201d: cohesion (strong mutual influence among its members), connectedness (high number of ties), and conciseness (low redundancy). We identify gaps in current knowledge, discuss the implications on managerial decision making, and suggest topics for future research.\n\n==\n\nCoulon 2005:\n\nTitle: The use of Social Network Analysis in Innovation Research: A literature review\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this paper is to review the innovation research literature which has made an explicit use of social network analysis methodology in order to provide empirical support to innovation theories or conceptual frameworks. The review introduces social network analysis then discusses why and how it has been used in innovation research so far. This paper argues that studies using social network analysis tend to focus too much on change in the relationships between interacting units or nodes of the network to the detriment of change within units/nodes.

Social networks have the potential to influence learning processes, provide opportunities for problem-solving, and establish new ideas. Thus, they can foster synergy effects, bring together key resources such as know-how of participating actors, and promote innovation diffusion. There is wide agreement regarding the usefulness of empirical methods of Social Network Analysis (SNA) for innovation and futures research. Even so, studies that show the chances of implementing SNA in these fields are still missing.

The FeCrCoNi and FeCrCoNiMn alloys were single-phase FCC solid-solutions in both conditions. However, the FeCrCoNiV and FeCrCoNiMnV alloys consisted of the intermetallic \u03c3-phase matrix with a tetragonal crystal lattice and precipitates of a disordered FCC phase. The crystal structures of these alloys were found to be not affected by annealing. A number of criteria were considered to explain phase composition of the studied alloys. It was shown that poor compatibility of V with other alloying elements caused significant distortions of FCC solid solution and thus promoted formation of the \u03c3 phase. Tensile and compressive properties of these alloys together with their microhardness were determined. Significant strengthening accompanied by the loss of ductility due to formation of the \u03c3 phase was demonstrated in the V containing alloys.

The as-cast alloys were cold rolled to a thickness reduction of 80% and annealed at 800\u00b0C for 1 hour. As a result, a fully recrystallized microstructure with a grain size of 6.4 \u03bcm was produced in the carbon-free alloy. The recrystallized grain size was much smaller (1.5 \u03bcm in the alloy with 2.0 at.% of C) due to the pinning effect of the precipitated M23C6 carbides. The yield strength of the alloys increased with an increase in the carbon concentration from 313 MPa to 636 MPa, while the elongation to fracture slightly decreased from 56% to 43%, respectively, in the alloys with 0 and 2 at.% of C. A decrease in the test temperature to 77K resulted in a significant increase in both the strength and ductility of the alloys. The alloys had high values of impact toughness of 140 J/cm2 and 85 J/cm2, respectively, in the alloys with 0 and 2 at.% of C.

The microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloys have been studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, room-temperature compressive tests and Vickers hardness tests. It has been found that Sn has a great effect on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloys. The CoCrFeMnNi alloy has a simple FCC phase structure, while a few white precipitations (MnNi2Sn-like) are observed in the Sn0.03 and Sn0.07 alloys. With further additions of Sn, the microstructure of Sn0.1, Sn0.3 and Sn0.5 changes to a typical dendrite structure, the dominated dendrite region has a lattice of FCC structure which is enriched with Cr, Co and Fe, and the interdendritic region is enriched with Mn, Ni and Sn. The volume of the MnNi2Sn-like phase increases with Sn content increasing. The addition of Sn enhances the formation of the MnNi2Sn-like phase in the CoCrFeMnNiSnx alloys, and improves the hardness and strength of as-cast alloys, but reduces the ductility of the alloys. The strengthening mechanism of alloys was solid solution strengthening and formation of the MnNi2Sn-like phase. In the CoCrFeMnNiSn0.03 and CoCrFeMnNiSn0.07 alloys, the solid solution is the dominant mechanism.

Microstructure and tensile mechanical behavior of the alloys in the as-cast condition were analyzed. The alloys with a low amount of N (0.5\u20131.0\u00a0at.%) had a single fcc phase coarse-grained microstructure. An increase in the content of N to 2.0\u00a0at.% resulted in the precipitation of a small amount (\u223c1%) of Cr-rich M2N nitride particles. The yield strength of the alloys increased in proportion to the percentage of nitrogen by 117\u00a0MPa/at% N at 293\u00a0K or by 316\u00a0MPa/at% N at 77\u00a0K. The observed increase in strength was attributed to solid solution hardening. Ductility of the alloy with 0.5 or 1.0\u00a0at.% of N increased with a decrease in the testing temperature while ductility of the alloy with 2\u00a0at.% dropped from 67% at 293\u00a0K to 8% at 77 K. The plastic deformation of the alloys at both 77\u00a0K or 293\u00a0K was mostly associated with planar dislocation slip. No signs of mechanical twinning were found even at 77\u00a0K. Thermo-Calc software was used to produce a quasi-binary CoCrFeMnNi\u2013N phase diagram for comparing the experimental and calculated results.

However, the stability of the constituent CrFeCoNi quaternary alloy, which forms the basis of many other high entropy systems, remains under debate and the existing literature contains very little long duration heat treatment data. Here, the phase equilibria of CrFeCoNi and CrMn 0.5 FeCoNi are assessed following 1000\u00a0h exposures at 500, 700 and 900\u00a0\u00b0C. Prior to thermal exposure the cast alloys were homogenised and shown to exist as single phase fcc solid solutions. In line with previous reports, Cr rich particles were observed on the grain boundaries following the prolonged exposures but detailed electron microscopy showed that these features were M 23 C 6 carbides resulting from the unintentional incorporation of C during production. However, no evidence was found for any other phase formation during the heat treatments of either alloy, in direct contrast to the results for CrMnFeCoNi. Consequently, it is concluded that, within the limits of the temperature and times considered, the solid solution phases of both CrFeCoNi and CrMn 0.5 FeCoNi are stable and that Mn has a destabilising influence when present in sufficient concentrations.

Christofidou (2018) concluded that the solid solution phases of both CrFeCoNi and CrMn0.5FeCoNi are stable, but Mn has a destabilising influence when present in sufficient concentrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the addition of Mn and other elements to Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni high entropy alloy systems can significantly influence their microstructure and mechanical properties, with effects ranging from changes in crystalline morphology and phase composition to alterations in strength, plasticity, and ductility. However, the specific effects can vary depending on the specific alloy system and the conditions under which it is studied."}, {"query": "Preferences of health seeking for patients with diabetes and obesity in India", "paper_list_string": "Nimesh 2019:\n\nTitle: Patterns of healthcare seeking behavior among persons with diabetes in Central India: A mixed method study\n\nAbstract: Background: Management of diabetes is complex and requires multiple lifestyle modifications, drug therapy, and a sustained regular follow-up. Complexities of health-seeking pattern in individuals with diabetes have been poorly characterized. Objectives: To understand the health-seeking patterns, and reasons of provider preference and switching among persons with diabetes. Materials and Methods: We performed a mixed methods study in an urban slum setting of Bhopal. This urban slum was chosen as being a field practice area of the institute, a complete sampling frame with listing of households, and individuals with chronic disease conditions (including diabetes) was available. To be included in the study, the individual should have been an adult, aged \u226520 years, and diagnosed as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Descriptive statistical analysis of sociodemographic and disease management variables was performed. For qualitative component, interviews were transcribed and primary coding was done by two investigators followed by condensation of codes into themes or categories. The frequency of these content categories was presented with count and proportions. Results: In total, 60 individuals with diabetes were interviewed. Of all individuals, 36 (60%) were asymptomatic at the time of the first diagnosis, and 57 (95%) were currently under treatment from some healthcare provider. About 25 (41.6%) switched their first provider and remaining continued with the same provider. Second provider was sought by 9 (36%) of 25 patients. Reasons for switching were perceived nonrelief, cost of care, distance of facility, and behavior of care provider. Conclusions: Healthcare provider switching is common among persons with diabetes which has implications on continuity of care.\n\n==\n\nAbidin 2014:\n\nTitle: Prevalence and Determinants of Appropriate Health Seeking Behaviour among Known Diabetics: Results from a Community-Based Survey\n\nAbstract: Introduction. Living with diabetes requires patients to have good self-monitoring of their disease and treatment. Appropriate health seeking behavior is important to minimize complications and improve quality of life. Methodology. A community-based, cross-sectional study of disease events and experiences from diagnosis to the time of study was conducted among 460 known diabetics in Tanjong Karang district. The aim of this study was to describe the current pattern of health seeking behavior and its determinants among rural communities. Appropriate diabetic health services utilization was defined as using modern treatment either through oral hypoglycemics or insulin injections, obtained from either a public or private health facility. Result. 85.9% of respondents reported having appropriate health seeking behaviour at the time of the house-to-house community survey. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that appropriate health seeking behaviour was significantly associated with age of respondent, presence of comorbidity, family history of diabetes, distance from health facilities, perceived family support, and history of early treatment seeking at diagnosis and duration of disease. Conclusion. The present population has better appropriate health seeking behavior and provision of knowledge with strong family support in diabetic care which are important in control and prevention of diabetic complication that need to be emphasized.\n\n==\n\nBhosale 2017:\n\nTitle: Healthcare-seeking behavior among diabetic patients in Kozhikode, Kerala -\n\nAbstract: Background: Diabetes mellitus is a global health problem. India has additional unique problem of treatment compliance of diabetic patients. Diabetic patients do not adhere to treatment and ultimately develop multiple chronic complications leading to irreversible disability and death. \n \nObjectives: To determine healthcare--seeking behavior and the health expenditure incurred for the treatment of diabetes in study population. \n \nMaterials and Methods: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015. House-to-house survey was done for data collection. A structured questionnaire was used for collecting data after explaining purpose of the study. All individuals with diabetes residing in area who consented for participation in the study were included in the study. Elderly individuals who were critically ill and were unable to comprehend questions were excluded from the study. Collected data were entered in Microsoft Excel and statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 16. \n \nResults: A total of 79 diabetic patients were interviewed. Their mean age was 61.51 \u00b1 11.8 years. 63.3% individuals belonged to upper socioeconomic class. Family history of diabetes was seen in 39.2% of the individuals. Only 34.1% patients used Government health facilities. 82.3% individuals were taking treatment regularly. Comorbidities associated with diabetes were seen in 69.6% of the individuals. The mean total monthly expenditure required for diabetes care was Rs. 1793. \n \nConclusions: Healthcare-seeking behavior among diabetic patients in Kerala is still low compared to diabetic patients in developed countries. Diabetic patients have to spend significant amount for traveling, consultation, and laboratory investigations along with expenditure for drugs and hospitalization.\n\n==\n\nRani 2019:\n\nTitle: Does health seeking behaviour influences on quality of life of type II diabetes patients, an untouched area in diabetes, study done in JSS Hospital, Mysore\n\nAbstract: Background: Diabetes mellitus\u00a0is a multisystem disorder associated with number of complications. If patients are to contribute to the effective control of diabetes, awareness and practices can assist in reducing the incidence of its complications.Methods: A cross-sectional study of 200 type II diabetic patients at JSS Hospital, Mysuru was conducted, assessment of health seeking behaviour using semi structured questionnaire was done. Quality of life was assessed using WHO QOL-BREF Questionnaire.Results: Among 200 study participants 53.5% belongs to age group 41-60, 57.5% were males, 44.5% were having family history of diabetes, 68.5% were on oral hypoglycemic agents. 163 (81.5%) were anxious when they were diagnosed as diabetics, 123 (61.5%) were influenced by themselves to go for investigations, 68 (34%)were influenced by Doctors, 131 (65.5%) had no money as the barrier to attend hospital for check-up, 186 (93%) visit hospital once in less than 3 months, 180 (90%) of them believed oral drugs are the treatment for diabetes, 188 (94%) prefer Allopathic medicine. Association between initial response on diagnosis and interval for regular monitoring with Quality of life of diabetic patients was statically significant (p\u22640.05).Conclusions: Health seeking behaviour is an important determinant of controlled glycaemic status and Quality of life of people living with diabetes.\n\n==\n\nKapur 1997:\n\nTitle: Diabetes Care in India --- Patient's Perceptions, Attitudes and Practices\n\nAbstract: Diabetes is a major health care problem in India. There are an estimated 30 million persons with diabetes, majority living in urban areas. Over 98% are believed to have Type 2 diabetes. There are no reliable figures on how many are diagnosed and how many treated. Based on sales of anti-diabetic pharmaceuticals, we estimate that a meagre 10-12% receive modern pharmacological treatment. All involved with diabetes care agree that patients play a major role in the successful management of diabetes. To be able to provide comprehensive care including appropriate education and advice it is essential to understand perceptions, attitudes and practices amongst patients with diabetes. Such studies are rarely conducted, and if conducted rarely reported. Physician\u2019s often decide on what is good for the patient based on their better knowledge of the disease and their assumptions are at best empirical. The treatment of diabetes, particular Type 2 requires constant review and change as the disease progresses. Initial treatment with diet and exercise, gives way to oral medications and further - to insulin, as has been known for long[1, 2, 3] and is now documented in UKPD study. Hesitation of patients to insulin therapy is well known and recognised but rarely researched and reported. Preliminary results from the UKPD study[4] indicate that 27% of the 676 patients assigned to insulin refused it initially, but does not examine the issue further. A recent study [5] examined NIDDM patients\u2019 fears and hopes about insulin therapy and recommended that health care providers examine their patient\u2019s perceptions, actively elicit and respond to patient needs to avoid unwitting promotion of negative attitudes toward diabetes management. In a separate paper we will report on physician\u2019s perceptions, attitudes and practice (DIPPAP-2 study) [6] and how these can influence patient attitudes. In this study we report from a survey on 475 persons with diabetes living in urban India, their attitudes, perceptions and practices.\n\n==\n\nShrivastava 2016:\n\nTitle: Obesity, Diabetes and Cardiovascular Diseases in India: Public Health Challenges.\n\nAbstract: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs; including coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes) are rapidly increasing in India causing nearly 5.8 million deaths per year. Primary reasons for rise in NCDs in India are nutrition and lifestyle transitions. Further, presence of higher body fat, abdominal fat, liver and pancreatic fat and lower lean mass than whites, contribute to heightened metabolic and cardiovascular risk in Asian Indians. Importantly, conversion from pre-diabetes to diabetes occurs more rapidly, and reversion to normal glucose regulation with appropriate lifestyle measures is more difficult in Asian Indians than white population. Huge number of patients with diabetes and with complications increase morbidity, mortality and pose substantial economic burden. It is difficult, though not impossible, to decrease pace of rapidly expanding juggernaut of NCDs in India. Only concerted efforts from multiple stakeholders, consistently sincere efforts and intensely focused attention from health officialdom and clear political will may help counter this increasingly difficult challenge. Finally, all prevention and management approaches should be cost-effective, pragmatic, and focused on children and underprivileged populations.\n\n==\n\nSilvanus 2022:\n\nTitle: Factors Influencing Health Seeking Behaviour among Persons with Diabetes Attending Urban Health Care Settings.\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nHealth seeking behaviour can influence outcomes in chronic diseases such as diabetes. As diabetes burden is higher in urban areas and under half receive adequate diabetes care and support in Nepal, this study aimed to assess factors influencing health behaviour among persons with diabetes attending urban health care settings.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cross-sectional study was conducted at two private healthcare settings with a pretested semi-structured questionnaire to assess health behaviour in particular with gender and regular diabetes follow-up. Bivariate analysis alongwith univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to assess factors that influence HSB (P<0.05). Adjusted odds were reported within 95% confidence intervals.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 385 PWDs (42.3% women) with a median diabetes duration of 7 years (IQR: 3 to 14 years), three fourths (75.1%, 95% CL: 70.5 to 79.1%) reported regular follow-up for diabetes care. After adjusting for confounders, the odds of regular follow-up were higher for those with a family history of diabetes (AOR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.11 to 3.00) and non-smokers (AOR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.34 to 3.61). The odds of follow-up were lower among the elderly (? 60 years) (AOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.97) and those with a family income below 35,000 Nepali rupees (AOR:0.39, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.67).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA plurality of health seeking behaviours such as regular follow-up care, taking glucose lowering medications and diabetes information seeking was observed among persons with diabetes attending private urban heath care settings during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Older age, family history of diabetes, non-smoking status and low family income were found to influence regular follow-up. In particular, psychosocial mechanisms that influence behavior among persons who smoke may need exploration.\n\n==\n\nGulati 2014:\n\nTitle: Sugar Intake, Obesity, and Diabetes in India\n\nAbstract: Sugar and sweet consumption have been popular and intrinsic to Indian culture, traditions, and religion from ancient times. In this article, we review the data showing increasing sugar consumption in India, including traditional sources (jaggery and khandsari) and from sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). Along with decreasing physical activity, this increasing trend of per capita sugar consumption assumes significance in view of the high tendency for Indians to develop insulin resistance, abdominal adiposity, and hepatic steatosis, and the increasing \u201cepidemic\u201d of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases. Importantly, there are preliminary data to show that incidence of obesity and T2DM could be decreased by increasing taxation on SSBs. Other prevention strategies, encompassing multiple stakeholders (government, industry, and consumers), should target on decreasing sugar consumption in the Indian population. In this context, dietary guidelines for Indians show that sugar consumption should be less than 10% of total daily energy intake, but it is suggested that this limit be decreased.", "final_summary": "The research question \"Preferences of health seeking for patients with diabetes and obesity in India\" has been addressed by several studies. \n\nNimesh (2019) found that 41.6% of diabetic patients switched their healthcare provider due to factors such as perceived nonrelief, cost of care, distance of facility, and behavior of care provider.

Withdrawal of tricyclic antidepressants may precipitate the development of discrete syndromes. The most common of these are general somatic or gastrointestinal distress with or without anxiety and agitation, sleep disturbance characterized by excessive and vivid dreaming and initial and middle insomnia, movement disorder, and psychic and behavioral activation extending on a continuum to frank mania. The etiology of these syndromes is discussed. The \"cholinergic overdrive hypothesis\" explains most antidepressant withdrawal phenomena, including infrequent manifestations. Some antidepressant withdrawal symptomatology may be due to an interaction between cholinergic overdrive and monoaminergic systems. A treatment program useful in ameliorating the distress of patients who develop antidepressant withdrawal symptoms and who cannot continue to take antidepressants is outlined. The theoretical significance of tricyclic withdrawal phenomena and the heuristic value of current hypotheses as to their pathophysiology are discussed.\n\n==\n\nLejoyeux 1996:\n\nTitle: Antidepressant Withdrawal Syndrome\n\nAbstract: SummaryWithdrawal from tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can produce somatic and psychological distress. Influenza-like syndromes, gastrointestinal adverse effects, arrhythmias, anxiety, sleep disturbances, movement disorders, mania or hypomania, panic attacks and delirium may follow antidepressant withdrawal. At present, the aetiology of withdrawal symptoms is not fully known.Withdrawal phenomena are usually prevented by gradually reducing the total daily dosage of the drug in question rather than abruptly discontinuing it. Antimuscarinic agents can be prescribed in order to alleviate the symptoms produced by the withdrawal of TCAs and MAOIs. To date, no drugs have been shown to be useful in the treatment of SSRI-associated withdrawal symptoms. The withdrawal syndrome associated with MAOIs may constitute a medical emergency.\n\n==\n\nTherrien 1997:\n\nTitle: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and withdrawal symptoms: a review of the literature\n\nAbstract: There are accumulating reports of withdrawal symptoms emerging following the discontinuation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. This report summarizes published reports, characterizes the withdrawal syndrome, discusses potential mechanisms of withdrawal, and makes recommendations for prevention and management. A computerized search was conducted using MEDLINE (1985\u20131996) to retrieve all case reports and pertinent studies of antidepressant withdrawal. A total of 46 case reports and two drug discontinuation studies were retrieved. All of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were implicated in withdrawal reactions with paroxetine most often cited in case reports. Withdrawal reactions were characterized most commonly by dizziness, fatigue/weakness, nausea, headache, myalgias and paresthesias. The occurrence of withdrawal did not appear to be related to dose or treatment duration. Symptoms generally appeared 1\u20134 days after drug discontinuation, and persisted for up to 25 days. Time of onset and duration of symptoms differed little among the agents. The pathophysiology/pharmacology of withdrawal is unclear but may involve multiple neurotransmitter systems. It is concluded that all of the SSRIs can produce withdrawal symptoms and if discontinued, they should be tapered over 1\u20132 weeks to minimize this possibility. Some patients may require a more extended tapering period. No specific treatment for severe withdrawal symptoms is recommended beyond reinstitution of the antidepressant with subsequent gradual tapering as tolerated. \u00a9 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n==\n\nRm 1997:\n\nTitle: Antidepressant Withdrawal Reactions\n\nAbstract: Antidepressants can cause a variety of withdrawal reactions, starting within a few days to a few weeks of ceasing the drug and persisting for days to weeks. Both tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors cause similar syndromes, most commonly characterized by gastrointestinal or somatic distress, sleep disturbances, mood fluctuations and movement disorders. Most symptoms related to tricyclic antidepressant withdrawal are believed to be caused by rebound excess of cholinergic activity after prolonged anticholinergic effect on cholinergic receptors. (This situation is analogous to the adrenergic rebound that occurs after beta-blocker withdrawal.) Treatment involves restarting the antidepressant and tapering it more slowly. Alternatively, tricyclic antidepressant withdrawal symptoms often respond to anticholinergics, such as atropine or benztropine mesylate. Three case reports of antidepressant withdrawal are presented, including one featuring akathisia (motor restlessness) related to withdrawal of venlafaxine.\n\n==\n\nHenssler 2019:\n\nTitle: Antidepressant Withdrawal and Rebound Phenomena.\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nAntidepressants are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide. They are often discontinued, frequently without the knowledge of the prescribing physician. It is, therefore, important for physicians to be aware of the withdrawal and rebound phenomena that may arise, in order to prevent these phenomena, treat them when necessary, and counsel patients appropriately.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis review is based on a comprehensive, structured literature search on antidepressant withdrawal phenomena that we carried out in the CENTRAL, PubMed (Medline), and Embase databases. We classified the relevant publications and reports by their methodological quality.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOut of a total of 2287 hits, there were 40 controlled trials, 38 cohort studies and retrospective analyses, and 271 case reports that met the inclusion criteria. Withdrawal manifestations are usually mild and self-limiting; common ones include dizziness, headache, sleep disturbances, and mood swings. More serious or pro- longed manifestations rarely arise. There is an increased risk with MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, venlafaxine, and paroxetine; on the other hand, for agome- latine and fluoxetine, abrupt discontinuation seems to be unproblematic. There is also some evidence of rebound phenomena, i.e., of higher relapse rates or especially severe relapses of depression after the discontinuation of an anti- depressant.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nA robust evidence base now indicates that there can be acute with- drawal phenomena when antidepressants are discontinued. Putative rebound phenomena have not been adequately studied to date. It is recommended that antidepressants should be tapered off over a period of more than four weeks.\n\n==\n\nDilsaver 1983:\n\nTitle: Antidepressant withdrawal symptoms treated with anticholinergic agents.\n\nAbstract: The authors describe three patients who developed withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of antidepressants.

The findings of the literature review highlighted hindrances to the adoption of hospital information systems to include; the high cost of full implementation of a hospital information system, inadequate human capital, corruption, and problems associated with poor infrastructure in Nigeria.

Many developed countries have either implemented or are in the process of implementing an Integrated Electronic Health Record (EHR) system because of its potential benefits. Pilot projects in many developing countries like Kenya, Malawi, Peru, and Haiti are demonstrating the viability of EHR in resource constrained areas. This study shows that the health system in Nigeria is pluralistic and complex with Federal, State and Local Governments, Health Related Agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations, private healthcare providers, patients, and researchers as the major stakeholders. The drivers for adoption of a nationwide EHR include the need to report data; improve patient safety, improve work place efficiency; comply with government reforms aimed at reducing the cost and increasing access to health services. Corruption, poor coordination among stakeholders, and lack of constant supply of electricity are some of the barriers to a successful implementation of a nationwide EHR.

The health care sector is still a labour-intensive handicraft industry, in spite of advances in technology, and health care provision has now become more complicated than in the past. Infant and under-five mortality rates are near the highest in the world, and maternal mortality is extremely high. It has the second largest number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in the world only next to South Africa and in 2008, between 3million and 3.5million people were estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS. Nigeria has the fourth highest number of TB cases in the world, with a 2004 estimate of 293 new cases per 100,000 population and 546 per 100,000 total cases. The reasons for a dysfunctional health system include: gross in adequate infrastructural support, electricity, potable water and diagnostic laboratories, very low per capita health spending, high out-of-pocket expenditure by citizens, and a total absence of a community-based integrated system for disease prevention, surveillance and treatment amongst others. Some strategies to tackle health sector challenges in Nigeria may include improved access to primary healthcare; strategic and purposeful leadership in health delivery services; increasing funding to the health sector; amongst others.\n\n==\n\nAdebayo 2014:\n\nTitle: Issues on E-health Adoption in Nigeria\n\nAbstract: E-health is the application of information technology for health care management.

Many factors contribute to the poor state of the medical sector of Nigeria, and in fact many developing countries, two of the most important being record keeping and accessibility. Nigeria still operates a paper based healthcare delivery system; meeting demands of citizens have been increasingly difficult due to her huge population, understaffed hospitals, apathy towards embracing ICTs and other issues.

Building Consensus on Drivers of Health Sector Corruption in Nigeria and Ways to Address It\n\nAbstract: Background: Corruption is widespread in Nigeria\u2019s health sector but the reasons why it exists and persists are poorly understood and it is often seen as intractable. We describe a consensus building exercise in which we asked health workers and policy-makers to identify and prioritise feasible responses to corruption in the Nigerian health sector. Methods: We employed three sequential activities. First, a narrative literature review identified which types of corruption are reported in the Nigerian health system. Second, we asked 21 frontline health workers to add to what was found in the review (based on their own experiences) and prioritise them, based on their significance and the feasibility of assessing them, by means of a consensus building exercise using a Nominal Group Technique (NGT). Third, we presented their assessments in a meeting of 25 policy-makers to offer their views on the practicality of implementing appropriate measures. Results: Participants identified 49 corrupt practices from the literature review and their own experience as most important in the Nigerian health system. The NGT prioritised: absenteeism, procurement-related corruption, under-the-counter payments, health financing-related corruption, and employment-related corruption. This largely reflected findings from the literature review, except for the greater emphasis on employment-related corruption from the NGT. Absenteeism, Informal payments and employment-related corruption were seen as most feasible to tackle. Frontline workers and policy-makers agreed that tackling corrupt practices requires a range of approaches. Conclusion: Corruption is recognized in Nigeria as widespread but often seems insurmountable. We show how a structured approach can achieve consensus among multiple stakeholders, a crucial first step in mobilizing action to address corruption.\n\n==\n\nAbel 2015:\n\nTitle: Funding E-Health in Nigeria by NGOS/Multinational Organization: Overview and Perspectives\n\nAbstract: Electronic-Health infrastructure tends to improve the quality of healthcare service delivery through timely access to information electronically with the aid of internet.

The factors preventing foreign NGOs and Multinational institutions from funding e-health projects in Nigeria were investigated. Data was obtained by conducting Semi-structured interview on prospective individuals of interest and from related academic journal papers. Individuals interviewed include, officials of World Health Organization (WHO), International Monetery Fund (IMF) and Swedish Support ICT Programs in Developing countries (SPIDER). Findings shows that lack of cooperation among healthcare stakeholders, political will and cultural barriers are some of the major factors preventing these Organizations from funding e-health projects. Recommendations were put forward in other to attracts these organizations to fund e-health projects in the conutry. Some of these recommendations include educating healthcare stakeholders what e-health is about, embarking on a sensitization program in the local, state and federal level.\n\n==\n\nOguntimilehin 2014:\n\nTitle: A Framework for Mobile Health Management for Diseases in Nigeria with Benefits and Challenges\n\nAbstract: World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that African Region has a shortfall of 817,992 health workers. Sub-Saharan Africa faces the greatest challenges with 11% of the world\u2019s population and 24% of the global burden of diseases; the region has only 3% of the world\u2019s health workers commanding less than 1% of world health expenditure. The ratio of available facilities to the teeming population is also grossly inadequate. These are among the major reasons why computer (Information Technology (IT)) has been employed over the years to help in different areas of health care- diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and medical records. It is very obvious that most of these computer based health management systems lack among other things the real time live interaction between health practitioners and patients. Mobile applications are now increasingly popular, though used mostly for instant messaging and social networking. In this paper we have proposed the use of mobile application to improve health care delivery system in Nigeria with real-time live chatting mode similar to the instant social chatting where diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients can be done through mobile technology. While readers\u2019 attention was drawn to this, a framework of the proposed system was developed for health practitioners and researchers to look into so as to move Nigeria and other developing countries in African forward in the health sector\n\n==\n\nYaqub 2012:\n\nTitle: PUBLIC HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND HEALTH OUTCOME IN NIGERIA: THE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE\n\nAbstract: A key element of public policy is the promotion of good health in order to attain broad based economic growth. Base on this paradigm, many countries devote huge budgetary allocation to health, but in most developing countries especially, this huge health expenditure failed to translate into better health status. This paper thus investigates how the effectiveness of public health expenditure is affected by governance in Nigeria. Data on public health expenditure and governance variable captured by the corruption perception index were regressed on infant mortality, under-five mortality and life expectancy, using both the ordinary least squares and the two-stage least squares. The result obtained showed that public health expenditure has negative effect on infant mortality and under-5 mortalities when the governance indicators are included. The policy implication is that achieving the Millennium development goal of lowering infant mortality by two-thirds by 2015; reducing under-5 mortality rate and raising life expectancy in Nigeria may be unattainable if the level of corruption is not reduced considerably.", "final_summary": "Implementing advanced health management information systems in Nigeria is a complex endeavor, as evidenced by the collective findings of several studies. \n\nBenson (2011) and Pantuvo (2011) both highlight several barriers to the implementation of hospital information systems and electronic health records respectively. These barriers include inadequate human capital, poor infrastructure, and corruption. Pantuvo (2011) also emphasizes the need for significant and sustainable funding, enforceable legislation, and a trained workforce for successful implementation.\n\nCorruption, a pervasive issue in Nigeria, is also identified as a major hindrance to progress in the health sector by Onwujekwe (2019). The study suggests that tackling corruption requires a multi-faceted approach and consensus among stakeholders. This sentiment is echoed by Abel (2015), who identifies lack of cooperation among healthcare stakeholders as a factor preventing foreign NGOs and multinational institutions from funding e-health projects in Nigeria.\n\nThe scarcity of funding is further highlighted by Obansa (2013) and Adebayo (2014), who point out the challenges of providing basic health services amidst high out-of-pocket expenditure by citizens and a lack of community-based integrated systems for disease prevention and treatment. Yaqub (2012) also underscores the impact of corruption on public health expenditure, suggesting that the effectiveness of such expenditure is significantly reduced by high levels of corruption.\n\nDespite these challenges, Oguntimilehin (2014) proposes the use of mobile technology to improve healthcare delivery, suggesting that real-time interaction between health practitioners and patients could be facilitated through mobile applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of advanced health management information systems in Nigeria is hindered by several factors, including inadequate human capital, poor infrastructure, corruption, and scarce funding. However, innovative solutions such as the use of mobile technology could potentially offer cost-effective alternatives. Addressing these challenges will require concerted efforts from all stakeholders, including the government, healthcare providers, and international organizations."}, {"query": "enhanced care coordination, transitions, and patient education in oncology readmissions", "paper_list_string": "Montero 2016:\n\nTitle: Reducing Unplanned Medical Oncology Readmissions by Improving Outpatient Care Transitions: A Process Improvement Project at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAbstract: PURPOSE\nReducing 30-day unplanned hospital readmissions is a national policy priority. We examined the impact of a quality improvement project focused on reducing oncology readmissions among patients with cancer who were admitted to palliative and general medical oncology services at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBaseline rates of readmissions were gathered during the period from January 2013 to April 2014. A quality improvement project designed to improve outpatient care transitions was initiated during the period leading to April 1, 2014, including: (1) provider education, (2) postdischarge nursing phone calls within 48 hours, and (3) postdischarge provider follow-up appointments within 5 business days. Nursing callback components included symptom management, education, medication review/compliance, and follow-up appointment reminder.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the baseline period, there were 2,638 admissions and 722 unplanned 30-day readmissions for an overall readmission rate of 27.4%. Callbacks and 5-day follow-up appointment monitoring revealed a mean monthly compliance of 72% and 78%, respectively, improving over time during the study period. Readmission rates declined by 4.5% to 22.9% (P < .01; relative risk reduction, 18%) during the study period. The mean direct cost of one readmission was $10,884, suggesting an annualized cost savings of $1.04 million with the observed reduction in unplanned readmissions.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nModest readmission reductions can be achieved through better systematic transitions to outpatient care (including follow-up calls and early provider visits), thereby leading to a reduction in use of inpatient resources. These data suggest that efforts focused on improving outpatient care transition were effective in reducing unplanned oncology readmissions.\n\n==\n\nEvans 2012:\n\nTitle: Patient-reported oncology readmission factors.\n\nAbstract: 48 Background: Reducing the risk of readmissions is an important quality goal for hospitals. Little is known of the perspectives of patients on underlying challenges that may lead to readmission. The objective of this study was to elicit perspectives of readmitted oncology patients on barriers to a successful transition from hospital to home.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAs part of a larger survey of readmitted inpatients, a 36-item survey was administered to 197 oncology patients readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge to home. Surveys were administered at The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (an urban tertiary care academic medical center) and Penn Presbyterian Medical Center (an affiliated urban community hospital), both located in Philadelphia. Responses were entered in real-time into the electronic medical record (EMR) and used by the care team to address patient concerns and improve quality.\n\n\nRESULTS\n45.2% of readmitted oncology patients reported challenges during the transition from hospital to home which they perceived as contributing to readmission. The most commonly reported transition challenges within the oncology population included difficulty with activities of daily living (ADLs) (17.8%), feeling unprepared for discharge (14.2%) and difficulty adhering to medications (7.1%). 15.2% of patients could not identify any modifiable factor contributing to readmission and reported returning simply because of symptoms from progressive illness. After adjusting for potential confounders (age, gender and severity of illness) using multivariable logistic regression models, uninsured and Medicaid patients were more likely than other patients to attribute readmission to difficulty accessing medications (OR 4.5, 95%CI 1.0, 19.9) and performing ADLs (OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.18, 6.1).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnderstanding challenges reported by readmitted oncology patients may enable inpatient oncologists to tailor transitions interventions to patient needs. Specifically, ensuring patients are able to perform necessary ADLs, are prepared for discharge and have assistance with medication adherence may help prevent unplanned readmissions. Uninsured and Medicaid patients may require additional assistance with accessing medications and ADLs.\n\n==\n\nMansukhani 2015:\n\nTitle: Exploring Transitional Care: Evidence-Based Strategies for Improving Provider Communication and Reducing Readmissions.\n\nAbstract: The coordination of care as patients move from one health care setting to another is crucial to treatment, but breakdowns in the process lead to poor transitions, fragmented care, hospital readmissions, and increased costs. This article discusses evidence-based strategies for improving communication and reducing readmissions.\n\n==\n\nBisognano 2009:\n\nTitle: Improving transitions to reduce readmissions.\n\nAbstract: Delivering high quality healthcare requires crucial contributions from many parts of the care continuum. However, as healthcare becomes increasingly specialized, coordination between providers and between settings is too often not conducted as a team effort. In the hospital setting, poor coordination of care often results in hospital readmissions, many of which are avoidable. In this article, we describe processes that hospitals can implement immediately to dramatically improve care transitions and reduce re-hospitalization rates. Readmission rates are a focus of interest for payers and policymakers seeking to promote efficiency and quality. Hospital executives may want to prepare their organization to excel on this performance metric in anticipation of payment, policy, and/or other forecasted changes in the market.\n\n==\n\nManzano 2015:\n\nTitle: Unplanned 30-Day Readmissions in a General Internal Medicine Hospitalist Service at a Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nAbstract: PURPOSE\nHospital readmissions are considered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid as a metric for quality of health care delivery. Robust data on the readmission profile of patients with cancer are currently insufficient to determine whether this measure is applicable to cancer hospitals as well. To address this knowledge gap, we estimated the unplanned readmission rate and identified factors influencing unplanned readmissions in a hospitalist service at a comprehensive cancer center.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe retrospectively analyzed unplanned 30-day readmission of patients discharged from the General Internal Medicine Hospitalist Service at a comprehensive cancer center between April 1, 2012, and September 30, 2012. Multiple independent variables were studied using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models, with generalized estimating equations to identify risk factors associated with readmissions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe observed a readmission rate of 22.6% in our cohort. The median time to unplanned readmission was 10 days. Unplanned readmission was more likely in patients with metastatic cancer and those with three or more comorbidities. Patients discharged to hospice were less likely to be readmitted (all P values < .01).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe observed a high unplanned readmission rate among our population of patients with cancer. The risk factors identified appear to be related to severity of illness and open up opportunities for improving coordination with primary care physicians, oncologists, and other specialists to manage comorbidities, or perhaps transition appropriate patients to palliative care. Our findings will be instrumental for developing targeted interventions to help reduce readmissions at our hospital. Our data also provide direction for appropriate application of readmission quality measures in cancer hospitals.\n\n==\n\nGrassman 1993:\n\nTitle: Development of inpatient oncology educational and support programs.\n\nAbstract: Support programs are needed to help patients manage the overwhelming emotions they experience when diagnosed and treated for cancer. Although many cancer support groups exist, most programs are designed for outpatients. Support groups for hospitalized patients and their families are an excellent way to provide greatly needed education and support to those who otherwise might not be able or willing to attend outpatient programs. Inpatient programs also offer the opportunity to provide support to people at the onset of diagnosis and treatment--a time when these services are particularly needed. This paper describes special considerations regarding the establishment of inpatient educational and support programs. The evolution of the Oncology Health Management Program of the Bay Pines VA Medical Center in Bay Pines, FL, also is presented. This multidisciplinary program for inpatients includes classes in spiritual support, family support, patient support, symptom management, stress management, and laughter therapy. Evaluation of the program revealed that classes that related symptom management were most useful and that laughter therapy and emotional support were reported to be highly beneficial as well. Nursing staff also gained from their participation in leading the program and expressed greater self-awareness and self-esteem. This has resulted in improved job satisfaction and staff retention as well as in more sensitive and compassionate delivery of patient care. These findings show that providing inpatient educational and support programs is an effective means of meeting the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs of patients with cancer and their families.\n\n==\n\nBell 2017:\n\nTitle: Systematic Review of Hospital Readmissions Among Patients With Cancer in the United States\n\nAbstract: Purpose/Objectives: To review the existing literature on readmission rates, predictors, and reasons for readmission among adults with cancer. Data Sources: U.S.\u2010based empirical studies reporting readmission rates from January 2005 to December 2015 were identified using four online library databases\u2014PubMed, CINAHL\u00ae, EconLit, and the online bibliography of the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program. Some articles were identified by the authors outside the database and bibliography searches. Data Synthesis: Of the 1,219 abstracts and 271 full\u2010text articles screened, 56 studies met inclusion criteria. The highest readmission rates were observed in patients with bladder, pancreatic, ovarian, or liver cancer. Significant predictors of readmission included comorbidities, older age, advanced disease, and index length of hospital stay. Common reasons for readmission included gastrointestinal and surgical complications, infection, and dehydration. Conclusions: Clinical efforts to reduce the substantial readmission rates among adults with cancer may target high\u2010rate conditions, infection prevention, proactive management of nausea and vomiting, and nurse\u2010led care coordination interventions for older adult patients with multiple comorbid conditions and advanced cancer. Implications for Nursing: Commonly reported reasons for readmission were nursing\u2010sensitivepatient outcomes (NSPOs), amenable to nursing intervention in oncology settings. These findings underscore the important role oncology nurses play in readmission prevention by implementing evidence\u2010based interventions to address NSPOs and testing their impact in future research.\n\n==\n\nBalogh 2011:\n\nTitle: Patient-centered cancer treatment planning: improving the quality of oncology care. Summary of an Institute of Medicine workshop.\n\nAbstract: The Institute of Medicine's National Cancer Policy Forum recently convened a workshop on patient-centered cancer treatment planning, with the aim of raising awareness about this important but often overlooked aspect of cancer treatment. A primary goal of patient-centered treatment planning is to engage patients and their families in meaningful, thorough interactions with their health care providers to develop an accurate, well-conceived treatment plan, using all available medical information appropriately while also considering the medical, social, and cultural needs and desires of the patient and family. A cancer treatment plan can be shared among the patient, family, and care team in order to facilitate care coordination and provide a roadmap to help patients navigate the path of cancer treatment. There are numerous obstacles to achieving patient-centered cancer treatment planning in practice. Some of these challenges stem from the patient and include patients' lack of assertiveness, health literacy, and numeracy, and their emotional state and concurrent illnesses. Others are a result of physician limitations, such as a lack of time to explain complex information and a lack of tools to facilitate treatment planning, as well as insensitivity to patients' informational, cultural, and emotional needs. Potential solutions to address these obstacles include better training of health care providers and patients in optimal communication and shared decision making, and greater use of support services and tools such as patient navigation and electronic health records. Other options include greater use of quality metrics and reimbursement for the time it takes to develop, discuss, and document a treatment plan.", "final_summary": "The collective findings from the selected papers suggest that enhanced care coordination, transitions, and patient education can significantly reduce oncology readmissions. \n\nMontero (2016) demonstrated that systematic transitions to outpatient care, including follow-up calls and early provider visits, led to a significant reduction in unplanned oncology readmissions.

We find that for the whole sample (1985\u20132010) Vietnam grew less than the rate predicted by the model. We also find that the balance-of-payments-constrained growth rate shifted after the 1997 Asian crisis. Since the relative price effect is neutral, the volume effects dominate in setting the balance-of-payments constraint. On the one hand, owing to the high income elasticities of exports, growth in advanced countries has a strong multiplier effect on the Vietnamese economy. On the other hand, this effect is hindered by a strong \u201cappetite\u201d for imports coming from Asia.

Vietnam\u2019s economy experienced a high economic growth rate, stable and sustainable macroeconomic environment. GDP growth is 6.81% (target 6.7%), CPI 3.53% (target (4%), credit growth 18,1%, and FDI of 36 billion USD. Import-export turnovers remain a significant achievement and has been maintained at a high level. Early results from restructuring of state-own enterprises signal a successful restructuring. These positive indicators provide impetus for the Vietnam\u2019s economy in 2018.

Four different steady-state equilibria are derived, each corresponding to different assumptions about the degree to which each class is organized to promote its own interests. In particular, the Goodwin growth cycle is shown to emerge from a world characterized by unorganized capitalists and workers, in which individuals ignore the effects of their own actions on economywide variables.

An analytical distinction is made between social (tensions/antagonism between classes) and political (class-based differences in political preferences) manifestations of class conflict. Using International Social Survey Program data (1999/2009) from 20 countries, the results indicate that social conflict is more common in meager welfare states where material inequality is relatively high compared to encompassing highly redistributive welfare states where levels of material inequality are relatively low. When it comes to distributive struggles in the political sphere \u2013 political conflict \u2013 the pattern is reversed. The results do not support arguments emphasizing that class as an analytical concept is irrelevant for understanding socio-political phenomena in modern industrial democracies. Instead, the results suggest that the character of class conflict varies across national socio-economic contexts in tandem with between-country variation in the institutional setup of the welfare state. The results support Walter Korpi\u2019s theory outlined in The Democratic Class Struggle, which suggests that in modern welfare states, institutionalized political conflict tends to replace less institutionalized and unorganized social conflict.

As more people are becoming active on comment websites and given the advances in natural language processing (NLP) techniques, it is feasible to conduct the opinion mining of comments regarding transportation services at large scale and low cost. In this study, >25,900 comments on websites regarding various public transportation services in Shanghai were analysed using NLP techniques, including sentiment analysis to calculate people's satisfaction with different transit facilities, keyword extraction to understand the key point in comments, and co-occurrence analysis to understand the commonality and characteristics of different routes. The sentiment analysis shows that people are more satisfied with traffic hubs than vehicles, and people have the highest level of satisfaction with airports and the lowest level of satisfaction with buses. The keywords classified by sentiment values show the strengths and weaknesses of Bus No. 49. Finally, the authors interpret a few anomalies of the results by tracing the context around the keywords.

Customer reviews can be used to automatically extract the most relevant aspects of the quality of service for hospitality clientele. This paper proposes a framework for the assessment of the quality of service in the hospitality sector based on the exploitation of customer reviews through natural language processing and machine learning methods. The proposed framework automatically discovers the quality of service aspects relevant to hotel customers. Hotel reviews from Bogot\u00e1 and Madrid are automatically scrapped from Booking.com. Semantic information is inferred through Latent Dirichlet Allocation and FastText, which allow representing text reviews as vectors. A dimensionality reduction technique is applied to visualise and interpret large amounts of customer reviews. Visualisations of the most important quality of service aspects are generated, allowing to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the quality of service. Results show that it is possible to automatically extract the main quality of service aspects perceived by customers from large customer review datasets. These findings could be used by hospitality managers to understand clients better and to improve the quality of service.\n\n==\n\nZhang 2008:\n\nTitle: A Model for Evaluating Service Quality Competitiveness Based on Linguistic Information\n\nAbstract: Service quality competitiveness is the focus of services quality management under economy globalization.

However, the relative importance and relationships between different determinants of satisfaction remains uncertain. Moreover, quantitative studies to date tend to test for significance of pre-determined factors thought to have an influence with no scalable means to identify other causes of user satisfaction. The gaps in knowledge make it difficult to use available knowledge on user preference for public service improvement. Meanwhile, digital technology development has enabled new methods to collect user feedback, for example through online forums where users can comment freely on their experience. New tools are needed to analyze large volumes of such feedback. Use of topic models is proposed as a feasible solution to aggregate open-ended user opinions that can be easily deployed in the public sector. Generated insights can contribute to a more inclusive decision-making process in public service provision. This novel methodological approach is applied to a case of service reviews of publicly-funded primary care practices in England. Findings from the analysis of 145,000 reviews covering almost 7,700 primary care centers indicate that the quality of interactions with staff and bureaucratic exigencies are the key issues driving user satisfaction across England.\n\n==\n\nChen 2001:\n\nTitle: Applying Linguistic Decision-Making Method to Deal with Service Quality Evaluation Problems\n\nAbstract: Today the evaluation of service quality is one of the most important management issues for every organization.

Both service descriptions and requirements are often expressed in natural language (NL), and natural language processing (NLP) tools that can match requirements and service descriptions, while filtering out irrelevant options, might alleviate the problem of choice overload faced by analysts. In this paper, we propose a NLP approach based on Knowledge Graphs that automates the process of service selection by ranking the service descriptions depending on their NL similarity with the requirements. To evaluate the approach, we have performed an experiment with 28 customer requirements and 91 service descriptions, previously ranked by a human assessor. We selected the top-15 services, which were ranked with the proposed approach, and found 53% similar results with respect to top-15 services of the manual ranking. The same task, performed with the traditional cosine similarity ranking, produces only 13% similar results. The outcomes of our experiment are promising, and new insights have also emerged for further improvement of the proposed technique.\n\n==\n\nLiou 2006:\n\nTitle: Subjective appraisal of service quality using fuzzy linguistic assessment\n\nAbstract: Purpose \u2013 This study proposes a conceptual model to assess the perceived service quality properly using fuzzy set theory, since customers' perceptions of service quality are generally expressed subjectively in vague linguistic termsDesign/methodology/approach \u2013 To demonstrate the proposed model, the exploratory prospect of empirical study with questionnaire is given in measuring the service quality.

The model employs Monte Carlo techniques. A sphere used for measurement of directional-hemispherical reflectance is modeled. The simulation allows sphere wall scattering to vary from perfectly Lambertian to perfectly specular in steps. The results demonstrate that significant measurement error can result as the scattering deviates from the Lambertian ideal. The error is found to be a strong function of the wall reflectance value as well: it is minimized for reflectances approaching 1.0 and increases as the reflectance value decreases to the minimum value examined of 0.5. The magnitudes of the errors associated with non-Lambertian scattering are also shown to be relatively independent of the specific field of view of the detector used in the measurement.\n\n==\n\nJeffries 2023:\n\nTitle: Toward open benchmark tests for automotive lidars, year 1: static range error, accuracy, and precision\n\nAbstract: Abstract. This paper describes the initial results from the first of 3 years of planned testing aimed at developing methods, metrics, and targets necessary to develop standardized tests for these instruments. Here, we evaluate range error accuracy and precision for eight automotive grade lidars; a survey grade lidar is used as a reference. These lidars are tasked with detecting a static, child-sized, target at ranges between 5 and 200 m. Our target, calibrated to 10% reflectivity and Lambertian, is a unique feature of this test. We find that lidar range precision is in line with the values reported by each manufacturer. However, we find that maximum range and target detection can be negatively affected by presence of an adjacent strong reflector. Finally, we observe that design trade-offs made by each manufacturer lead to important performance differences that can be quantified by tests such as the ones proposed here. This paper also includes some lessons learned, planned improvements, and discussion of future iterations of this activity.\n\n==\n\nRagheb 2002:\n\nTitle: Lambertian reflectance correction for rough and shiny surfaces\n\nAbstract: For rough and smooth surfaces, there are departures from Lambertian reflectance at the occluding limb. This is due to backscattering from microfacets which protrude above the surface. These departures from Lambertian reflectance limit the applicability of shape-from-shading to the surface. We consider how to reconstruct the Lambertian reflectance component in order to improve the quality of surface normal information recoverable using shape-from-shading. We show that although this correction process is reasonable when the light source and viewing directions are close to one another, it is not applicable when the directions are perpendicular.\n\n==\n\nKimes 1982:\n\nTitle: Irradiance measurement errors due to the assumption of a Lambertian reference panel\n\nAbstract: Abstract Total and diffuse global spectral irradiances, which are often required field measurements in remote sensing, are commonly obtained by measuring the radiance from a horizontal reference panel with assumed Lambertian properties. A technique is presented for determining the error in diurnal irradiance measurements that results from the non-Lambertian behavior of a reference panel under various irradiance conditions. Spectral biconical reflectance factors of a spray-painted barium sulfate panel, along with simulated sky radiance data for clear and hazy skies at six solar zenith angles, were used to calculate the estimated panel irradiances and true-irradiances for a nadir-looking sensor in two wavelength bands. The inherent errors in total spectral irradiance (0.68 \u03bcm) for a clear sky were 0.60, 6.0, 13.0, and 27.0% for solar zenith angles of 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 75\u00b0.

It is used explicitly by methods such as shape from shading and photometric stereo, and implicitly by methods such as binocular stereo and motion detection. For several real-world objects, the Lambertian model can prove to be a very inaccurate approximation to the diffuse component. While the brightness of a Lambertian surface is independent of viewing direction, the brightness of a rough diffuse surface increases as the viewer approaches the source direction. A comprehensive model is developed that predicts reflectance from rough diffuse surfaces. The model accounts for complex geometric and radiometric phenomena such as masking, shadowing, and interreflections between points on the surface. Experiments have been conducted on real samples, such as, plaster, clay, sand, and cloth. All these surfaces demonstrate significant deviation from Lambertian behavior. The reflectance measurements obtained are in strong agreement with the reflectance predicted by the proposed model. The paper is concluded with a discussion on the implications of these results for machine vision.\n\n==\n\nDeems 2006:\n\nTitle: Lidar Measurement of Snow Depth: Accuracy and Error Sources\n\nAbstract: Airborne laser altimetry (lidar) is a remote sensing technology that holds tremendous promise for mapping snow depth in snow hydrology and avalanche applications. In recent years lidar has seen a dramatic widening of applications in the natural sciences, resulting in technological improvements and an increase in the availability of sensors. Modern sensors allow recording of multiple pulse returns, which allows mapping of vegetation heights and surface elevations below forest canopies. Typical reported vertical accuracies are on the order of 15 cm with an average ground point spacing of 1.5 m. However many parameters in the lidar acquisition process, such as laser scan angle, laser pulse rate, and flight geometry relative to terrain gradients require consideration to ensure adequate point coverage in forested and/or mountainous terrain. Additionally, laser light interaction with the snow surface has a significant volumetric scattering component, requiring different considerations for surface height error estimation than for other earth surface materials. The penetration depth of the laser pulse (NIR wavelength of 1064 nm) is dependent primarily on grain size, liquid water content, and the angle of incidence. Using published estimates of penetration depth, we estimate radiative transfer contribution to depth measurement errors to be on the order of 1 cm. In this paper, we present a review of lidar altimetry procedures and error sources, investigate potential errors unique to snow surface remote sensing in the NIR wavelengths, and make recommendations for projects using lidar for snow depth mapping.\n\n==\n\nFukuchi 2001:\n\nTitle: Evaluation of differential absorption lidar (DIAL) measurement error by simultaneous DIAL and null profiling\n\nAbstract: A differential absorption lidar system for measurement of trace atmospheric substances in the visible and UV regions is developed.

The measurement error of the system was evaluated by measurement of tropospheric O3 using two identical differential absorption lidar (DIAL) pairs, from which two null profiles and four DIAL profiles are obtained simultaneously. The null profiles, obtained for both the on and off wavelengths used in DIAL measurement, are useful to evaluate systematic DIAL measurement error due to beam misalignment. The null profiles show that this systematic error is at most 1.3%. The total DIAL measurement error is about 5%, most of which can be attributed to statistical error.\n\n==\n\nBelmonte 2006:\n\nTitle: Turbulence-induced measurement errors in coherent differential absorption lidar ground systems.\n\nAbstract: The presence of atmospheric refractive turbulence makes it necessary to use simulations of beam propagation to examine the uncertainty added to the differential absorption lidar (DIAL) measurement process of a practical heterodyne lidar.

Glucocorticoid exposure was defined 3 ways: tertiles of cumulative exposure; recent use (< or =3 months) versus past use (>3 months); and average daily dosage (< or =7.5 mg/day or >7.5 mg/day). CV events, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death from CV causes, were defined according to validated criteria. Cox regression models were adjusted for demographic features, CV risk factors, and RA characteristics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRheumatoid factor (RF)-negative patients with exposure to glucocorticoids were not at increased risk of CV events, irrespective of the glucocorticoid dosage or timing of use, as compared with the reference group of RF-negative patients who had never been exposed to glucocorticoids. In contrast, RF-positive patients were at increased risk of CV events, particularly with higher cumulative exposure, higher average daily dosage, and recent use of glucocorticoids. RF-positive patients with high cumulative exposure to glucocorticoids had a 3-fold increased risk of CV events (hazard ratio 3.06 [95% confidence interval 1.81-5.18]), whereas RF-negative patients with high cumulative exposure were not at increased risk (hazard ratio 0.85 [95% confidence interval 0.39-1.87]).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nRF-positive but not RF-negative patients were at increased risk of CV events following exposure to glucocorticoids.

Methods Retrospective analysis of exposure to glucocorticoids in a prospective cohort of 353 patients with rheumatoid arthritis followed from June 2001 up to November 2011 for incident cardiovascular disease in a hospital-based outpatient cohort in the Netherlands. Hazard ratios with 95%-confidence intervals were calculated for the association between different types of exposure to glucocorticoids and incident cardiovascular disease. Associations were adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and disease related parameters. Results Recent and current exposure to glucocorticoids were associated with incident cardiovascular disease, as was a longer duration of exposure and cumulative exposure to glucocorticoids. Adjustment for disease activity and severity negated the association. Conclusion In observational studies the finding of incident cardiovascular disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis exposed to glucocorticoids is strongly confounded by indication due to high disease activity. The adverse cardiovascular effects of glucocorticoids might be balanced by positive effects working through inflammation control.\n\n==\n\nDavis 2005:\n\nTitle: Use of low-dose glucocorticoids and the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in rheumatoid arthritis: what is the true direction of effect?\n\nAbstract: People with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) experience an increased burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and reduced survival compared to the general population1. Myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure appear to be more prevalent in RA compared to subjects without RA2. In one study, the risk of congestive heart failure was 2-fold higher among RA subjects compared to non-RA controls3. Much of the best evidence suggests that systemic inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CVD in RA1. Still, a nagging question persists in the minds of many rheumatologists today: What is the role of glucocorticoids (GC)? A common view is that GC harm the cardiovascular system. We wish to examine an alternative hypothesis: that GC might actually reduce the risk of CVD in patients with RA. Our aim is not to provide a comprehensive review of the cardiovascular effects of GC but rather to bring balance to the debate of how use of GC might affect the development of CVD in patients with RA. A discussion of GC is highly relevant given current rheumatology practice. GC have been used to treat people with RA for the last half-century, and recently, there has been renewed interest in these medications4. Use of GC is highly prevalent among people with RA; for example, these are taken by 30\u201350% of patients enrolled in recent therapeutic trials5. Rheumatologists commonly use GC as \u201cbridge therapy\u201d awaiting efficacy of slow-acting disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD), and also for treating disease flares. Frequently, delays occur in initiating biologic agents due to time required for insurance company authorization, tuberculin skin testing, and/or patient education visits. For these reasons, GC will likely continue to be an important component of the armamentarium for patients with RA, at least for the foreseeable future. Despite years of use, relatively little is known regarding the longterm effects of GC, particularly on the development of CVD4. In light of the increased burden of CVD in RA, it is critical to better understand how GC affect the development of CVD in this population, whether beneficial or harmful. Inflammation plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of CVD in RA. For example, abnormalities in traditional cardiovascular risk factors alone cannot explain the increased risk of CVD in this population6. Also, clinical features in RA that are associated with high inflammatory disease activity such as elevated acute phase markers and extraarticular manifestations are associated with cardiovascular events and mortality3,7-10. Theoretically, GC could modulate the risk of CVD in RA in 2 competing ways. The risk could increase due to potentially deleterious effects of GC on lipids, glucose tolerance, hypertension, or obesity11. Alternatively, by alleviating systemic inflammation, GC may actually decrease the risk of atherosclerosis and CVD1,12. Evidence supporting both directions of effect will be reviewed. Furthermore, there is evidence that effective treatment of systemic inflammation with DMARD is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular mortality13. Treatment with antagonists of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) may lower the risk of heart failure14. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider the possibility that GC may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. A number of novel findings in epidemiological studies suggest that \u201cflares\u201d of inflammation in RA may be involved in triggering cardiovascular events. First of all, the risk of cardiovascular events is independent of the duration of RA8. Second, the risk of sudden death and silent MI appears to be increased very early, even prior to patients ful-\n\n==\n\nRinc\u00f3n 2014:\n\nTitle: Glucocorticoid Dose Thresholds Associated With All\u2010Cause and Cardiovascular Mortality in Rheumatoid Arthritis\n\nAbstract: To delineate daily and cumulative glucocorticoid dose thresholds associated with increased mortality rates in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n==\n\nBoers 2003:\n\nTitle: Influence of glucocorticoids and disease activity on total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with rheumatoid arthritis\n\nAbstract: Background: Glucocorticoids induce hypercholesterolaemia, a cardiovascular risk factor, in patients with diseases other than rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the data in RA are contradictory. Objective: To determine the effects of antirheumatic treatment, including prednisolone (combination) therapy on total and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in RA, taking disease activity into account. Methods: HDL cholesterol and total cholesterol levels were determined in:(a) established RA (b) two cohorts with early active RA, (c) a previously conducted 56 week trial among patients with early RA comparing the value of intensive combination therapy (that included glucocorticoids) with sulfasalazine alone (COBRA trial). Results: In established RA total cholesterol levels were only slightly raised, irrespective of disease activity. However, HDL cholesterol was significantly higher in patients in remission than in patients with active disease. In contrast, in active early RA at baseline total cholesterol was low normal: between 4.6 and 5.1 mmol/l in the different populations. The level of HDL cholesterol was highly dependent on the duration of storage. In both COBRA groups total cholesterol increased by a mean of 0.6 mmol/l. HDL cholesterol increased by more than 50% after treatment, leading to an improvement of the total cholesterol/HDL ratio (atherogenic index). This increase (and index improvement) was much more rapid in the group receiving combination treatment. A similar pattern was seen in the 2001 cohort with early RA. In all the groups with active disease HDL and total cholesterol levels correlated inversely with disease activity. Conclusion: In established, but especially in early RA, disease activity is accompanied by atherogenic lipid levels. This dyslipidaemia can be rapidly reversed by aggressive antirheumatic treatment including glucocorticoids.\n\n==\n\nRinc\u00f3n 2004:\n\nTitle: Effect of glucocorticoids on the arteries in rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nGlucocorticoids are suspected to cause atherosclerosis. Because of the possibility that their antiinflammatory effect may be antiatherogenic, this study investigated the effect of glucocorticoids on the arteries of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe assessed the arteries of 647 patients with RA. Central atherosclerosis was measured using high-resolution carotid ultrasound for the presence of plaque and for the extent of carotid artery intima-media thickness (CaIMT). Peripheral atherosclerosis was assessed using the systolic pressures of the dorsal pedal, posterior tibial, and brachial arteries to obtain the ankle-brachial index (ABI). Cumulative glucocorticoid dose was determined using pharmacy records, supplemented by self-report. Cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and RA clinical manifestations were ascertained using clinical and laboratory methods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the RA patients studied, 427 (66%) had received glucocorticoids. Of those who had never received glucocorticoids, 100 (47%) of 215 had carotid plaque and 17 (8%) of 219 had > or =1 incompressible lower-limb artery (ABI >1.3). Among patients in the highest tertile of lifetime glucocorticoid exposure (>16.24 gm prednisone), the frequency of carotid plaque increased to 85 (62%) of 138 (P = 0.006) and that of lower-limb arterial incompressibility increased to 24 (17%) of 140 (P = 0.008), with differences remaining significant after adjustment for age at onset, disease duration, sex, CV risk factors, and RA clinical manifestations (tender, swollen, and deformed joint counts, subcutaneous nodules, rheumatoid factor seropositivity, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate). The CaIMT also displayed an increase with higher glucocorticoid exposure, but the differences did not reach significance. Lower-limb artery obstruction (ABI < or =0.9) was not associated with glucocorticoid exposure.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this RA sample, glucocorticoid exposure was associated with carotid plaque and arterial incompressibility, independent of CV risk factors and RA clinical manifestations. This supports a role for glucocorticoids in the CV complications that occur in RA.\n\n==\n\nWei 2004:\n\nTitle: Taking Glucocorticoids by Prescription Is Associated with Subsequent Cardiovascular Disease\n\nAbstract: Context Patients who take glucocorticoids appear to have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, data about the magnitude of this increased risk are lacking Contribution In this large, population-based study, the use of glucocorticoids was associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events, with a clear dose-response relationship. Patients who received high-dose glucocorticoids were more than 2.5 times as likely as patients who did not use glucocorticoids to experience a cardiovascular event. Implications These data will help clinicians estimate cardiovascular risk among patients who require glucocorticoids. The Editors Glucocorticoids are commonly used as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapy in diseases such as asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and inflammatory arthritis. Well-known adverse effects of glucocorticoids include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity (1-3), all of which are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The principal physiologic glucocorticoid is cortisol. Increased cortisol secretion and action, even within the physiologic range, is associated with several risk factors for cardiovascular disease (4, 5). Indeed, studies have proposed that subclinical Cushing syndrome may be an important cardiovascular risk factor (6, 7). However, whether, and to what extent, the adverse effects of exogenous glucocorticoids on these risk factors for cardiovascular disease cause cardiovascular morbidity and death has not been established (8, 9). This is not predictable, especially since glucocorticoids may also have cardioprotective effects mediated by their anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative actions in the vessel wall (10, 11). We tested the hypothesis that users of exogenous glucocorticoids have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. In particular, we hypothesized that high doses will be associated with cardiovascular disease, while doses equivalent to or below the physiologic range of endogenous glucocorticoid secretion may be compensated for by decreased cortisol levels and will not incur excessive risk. We have tested this by using the MEdicines MOnitoring unit (MEMO) record linkage database to compare people who were exposed and not exposed to glucocorticoid therapy. Methods We performed this study in the Tayside region in Scotland by using the MEMO record linkage database. The MEMO database covers a geographically compact population and serves about 400000 patients in the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland, 97% of whom are white. The NHS in Scotland is tax-funded and free at the point of consumption and covers the entire population. In Tayside, almost no health care is delivered without the NHS. The data collection methods for this database have previously been described (12). In brief, this database contains several data sets, including all dispensed community prescriptions, hospital discharge data, mortality data, biochemistry data, and other data, that are linked by a unique patient identifier, the community health index number. These data are made anonymous for the purposes of research, as approved by the Tayside Caldicott Guardians (a group appointed by the government to protect the confidentiality of medical records). The Tayside committee on research medical ethics also approved the project. We cleaned and validated all data before analysis. We included all patients who resided in Tayside and registered with a general practitioner in January 1993, who were 40 years of age or older, and who remained a resident in Tayside until December 1997 or who died during the study period. Definitions of Exposure to Glucocorticoids Exposed and Comparator Cohorts All patients who received 1 or more dispensed prescriptions for glucocorticoids (including inhaled steroids, topical steroids, oral and parenteral steroids, rectal application steroids, and nasal steroids) between July 1993 and December 1996 formed the exposed cohort. They entered the study at their date of first prescription. The rest of the study sample made up the comparator cohort. We excluded patients who were hospitalized for inflammatory bowel disease and chronic obstructive airways disease during the follow-up period because they may have been given glucocorticoids as hospital inpatients without the prescriptions being identified by MEMO. We generated a random date of entry to the study for each member of the comparator cohort by using a frequency-matched calendar year generated from the dates of entry to the study in the exposed cohort. We excluded patients from both cohorts if they were hospitalized for cardiovascular disease before study entry. Dose of Glucocorticoids For about two thirds of dispensed oral or systemic glucocorticoid prescriptions, we recorded the date of prescription, dose of tablets, amount dispensed, and instructions on how medication should be taken. For these prescriptions, we could determine daily exposure during prescribed courses. For the remainder, we knew the total dose dispensed but, because prescriptions were marked take as directed, could not accurately determine the daily dose and duration. We therefore calculated the average daily dose by dividing the total amount of glucocorticoid dispensed by the total number of days of observation. For multiple simultaneous formulations (oral and inhaled) of glucocorticoids, we used only the oral glucocorticoids to calculate the daily dose. We categorized glucocorticoid exposure according to average daily doses throughout the follow-up period for each patient as high (oral, parenteral, and rectal steroids with daily dosage 7.5 mg [that is, supraphysiologic doses]); medium (oral, parenteral, and rectal steroids with daily dosage <7.5 mg [that is, approximately equivalent to the physiologic range of endogenous glucocorticoid secretion]); or low (inhaled, topical, and nasal steroids with daily dosage less than the equivalent physiologic range). As a result of this calculation, we included patients who took large dosages for a short period in the medium-dose group. We calculated dose equivalents of prednisolone as follows: 1 mg of prednisolone = 5 mg of cortisone = 4 mg of hydrocortisone = 1 mg of prednisone = 0.8 mg of triamcinolone = 0.8 mg of methylprednisolone = 0.15 mg of dexamethasone = 0.15 mg of betamethasone (13). The MEMO database does not collect information for prescriptions dispensed in hospitals. We considered participants hospitalized for asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (disorders usually treated with high-dose glucocorticoids in the hospital) as being exposed to a typical dosage of glucocorticoids (30 mg/d, prednisolone) during that period. Analysis of Events during Glucocorticoid Exposure (On Treatment vs. Off Treatment) We did a subgroup analysis of those patients for whom we had data on daily dose of glucocorticoid exposure. For each patient, we divided exposure to glucocorticoid into the time that the patient was exposed (on treatment) and the time that the patient was not exposed (off treatment). We then temporally related these periods to the occurrence of cardiovascular events. Incident versus Prevalent Use For each patient in the cohort exposed to glucocorticoids, we used the 6 months before entry to the study as a screening period. We classified patients who did not receive glucocorticoids during this period as incident users of glucocorticoids and patients who received glucocorticoids during this period as prevalent users. Continuous versus Intermittent Use We did an analysis comparing cardiovascular risk in continuous use (180 days between prescriptions) versus intermittent use (>180 days between prescriptions). Exposure by Disease Indication We identified patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease if they were hospitalized for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or were prescribed an inhaled steroid or bronchodilator drug before study entry. We identified patients with inflammatory bowel disease if they were hospitalized for colitis or were prescribed a rectal steroid preparation before study entry. We identified patients with inflammatory arthritis if they were hospitalized for inflammatory arthritis or were prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs before study entry. Outcome Variables We collected the outcome data on each patient until 31 December 1997. The outcome of the study was a cardiovascular event defined as the composite end point of hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of myocardial infarction, angina, angioplasty or coronary revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, congestive cardiac failure, or cardiovascular death during follow-up. We censored patients at their first event if they had several events. We ascertained diagnoses of myocardial infarction, angina, angioplasty and coronary revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and congestive cardiac failure from the hospital discharge diagnosis data, which were validated (14) in the Scottish Morbidity Record 1 by primary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revisions, codes. We also ascertained diagnoses of angioplasty and coronary revascularization by the code of classification of surgical operations and procedures. We also obtained the death certification data for all Tayside residents who died. Statistical Analysis We counted events that occurred during the study period and compared rates of events between cohorts. We used the Poisson regression model to investigate the association between glucocorticoid exposure and cardiovascular outcome. We included the following covariates: age at study entry; sex; social deprivation; use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, -blockers, -blockers, calcium-channel blockers, cardiac glycosides, diuretics, nitrates, lipid-lowering drugs, hormone replacement the\n\n==\n\nBoers 2015:\n\nTitle: Drugs and cardiovascular risk in inflammatory arthritis: another case of glucocorticoid-bashing?\n\nAbstract: I read with interest the meta-analysis by Roubille et al ,1 especially for the adverse effects noted with glucocorticoids (GCs).

In the early part of the financial crisis, margins fell to the bottom of this range, reflecting an increase in debt funding costs. Margins have since recovered a little, to around the middle of the range, as a result of some repricing of lending rates relative to these costs. In addition to the increase in the cost of debt funding, there have been other drivers of the rise in lending rates relative to the cash rate. First, the banks have increased their equity funding, which is more costly than debt finance. Second, risk margins on loans have risen to account for higher expected losses.\n\n==\n\nDuquerroy 2022:\n\nTitle: Tracing Banks\u2019 Credit Allocation to their Funding Costs\n\nAbstract: We quantify how banks\u2019 funding costs affect their lending behavior directly, and indirectly by feeding back to their net worth. For identification, we exploit banks\u2019 heterogeneous liability structure and the existence of regulated deposits in France whose rates are set by the government. Using administrative credit-registry and regulatory bank data, we find that a one-percentage-point increase in funding costs reduces credit by 17%.

These changes are not compensated for by less affected banks at the aggregate city level, with repercussions for firms\u2019 investment.

The concerns have so far mainly affected the euro area, where some countries have seen their credit ratings downgraded during 2009\u221211 and their funding costs rise sharply. Other countries have also been affected, but to a much lesser extent. Greater sovereign risk is already having adverse effects on banks and financial markets. Looking forward, sovereign risk concerns may affect a broad range of countries. In advanced economies, government debt levels are expected to rise over coming years, due to high fiscal deficits and rising pension and health care costs. In emerging economies, vulnerability to external shocks and political instability may have periodic adverse effects on sovereign risk. Overall, risk premia on government debt will likely be higher and more volatile than in the past. In some countries, sovereign debt has already lost its risk-free status; in others, it may do so in the future. The challenge for authorities is to minimise the negative consequences for bank funding and the flow-on effects on the real economy. This report outlines the impact of sovereign risk concerns on the cost and availability of bank funding over recent years. It then describes the channels through which sovereign risk affects bank funding. The last section summarises the main conclusions and discusses some implications for banks and the official sector. Two caveats are necessary before discussing the main findings. First, the analysis focuses on causality going from sovereigns to banks, as is already the case in some countries, and, looking forward, is a possible scenario for other economies. But causality may clearly also go from banks to sovereigns. However, even in this second case, sovereign risk eventually acquires its own dynamics and compounds the problems of the banking sector. Second, the report examines the link between sovereign risk and bank funding in general terms, based on recent experience and research. It does not assess actual sovereign risk and its impact on bank stability in individual countries at the present juncture.\n\n==\n\nBabihuga 2014:\n\nTitle: Bank Funding Costs for International Banks\n\nAbstract: This paper investigates the determinants of bank funding costs for a sample of internationally active banks from 2001\u201312. We find that changes in banks\u2019 unsecured funding costs are associated with bank-specific characteristics such as an institution\u2019s credit worthiness and the return on its market value, and importantly, on the level and quality of capital. Similarly, market factors such as the level of investor risk appetite, as well as shocks to financial markets\u2014notably the US subprime crisis and the Euro Area sovereign debt crisis\u2014have also been key drivers of the sharp rise in bank funding costs. We also find evidence that large systemically important institutions have enjoyed a funding advantage, and that this advantage has risen since the onset of the two crises. With the exception of Euro Area periphery banks, by end-2012 the rise in funding costs had generally been reversed for most major banks as a result of improvments in bank asset quality as well as steps taken to increase resilience, notably higher capitalization. Our results suggest increased capital buffers may potentially support bank lending to the real economy by reducing bank funding costs.\n\n==\n\nBabihuga 2014:\n\nTitle: Bank Funding Costs for International Banks\n\nAbstract: This paper investigates the determinants of bank funding costs for a sample of internationally active banks from 2001\u201312.

Expansion into non-interest income generating activities such as trading increases the rate of return on assets, and it may offer some risk diversification benefits at very low levels. Non-deposit, wholesale funding in contrast lowers the rate of return on assets, while it can offer some risk reduction at commonly observed low levels of non-deposit funding. A sizeable proportion of banks, however, attract most of their short-term funding in the form of non-deposits at a cost of enhanced bank fragility.

This risk is a major concern for policymakers, who need to intervene to prevent the funding liquidity freeze from triggering the bankruptcy of solvent financial institutions. We construct a new indicator of rollover risk for banks, which we call the forward funding spread. It is calculated as the difference between the three-month forward rate of the yield curve constructed using only instruments with a three-month tenor and the corresponding forward rate of the default-free overnight interest swap yield curve. The forward funding spread usefully complements its spot equivalent, the IBOR-OIS spread, in the monitoring of bank funding risk in real time. First, it accounts for market participants' expectations of how funding costs will evolve over time. Second, it identifies liquidity regimes, which coincide with the levels of excess liquidity supplied by central banks. Third, it has much higher predictive power for economic growth and bank lending in the United States and the euro area than the spot IBOR-OIS, credit default swap spreads or bank bond credit spreads.", "final_summary": "The research question at hand explores the intricate relationship between bank funding costs and credit risk.

Two straight-run fuels and two fuels containing catalytically cracked fractions were stored in 100 bbl above-ground steel tanks for two years. The fuels were sampled initially and periodically during storage; each sample was analyzed for existent gum, particulates, and ASTM D2274 stability. Two of the fuels maintained satisfactory storage stability throughout the entire two-year storage period. One fuel was considered marginal with respect to storage stability since its initially low values for gum and particulate contamination were followed by gradually increasing values. The fourth fuel exhibited a cyclic pattern of gum and particulate values typical of unsatisfactory storage stability. These results indicated that production diesel fuels meeting the requirements of Federal Specification VV-F-800a might not have satisfactory storage stability.\n\n==\n\nBento 2001:\n\nTitle: Biodeterioration of stored diesel oil: studies in Brazil\n\nAbstract: Abstract The problems of hydrocarbon fuel storage in Brazil are particularly acute for diesel fuel. Visits to bus depots showed that many foremen did not understand the importance of draining water bottoms regularly and most systems were microbially contaminated. Common fungal isolates from refineries and distribution systems, Hormoconis resinae , Aspergillus niger , Aspergillus fumigatus , Paecilomyces variotii , and Candida silvicola , grew equally well in laboratory diesel/water systems with or without a chemical additive mixture, showing that this package of compounds neither promoted nor retarded fungal growth. Non-sterilised diesel was stored for 450 days over a water bottom, with or without an isothiazolone biocide, in the laboratory. The fungi most frequently detected in the non-biocide treated systems were H. resinae , A fumigatus , P. variotii , a Penicillium sp., and the yeasts, Rhodotorula glutinis and Candida silvicola . Bacterial isolates included oxidative Gram negative rods, sulphate-reducing bacteria and a Micrococcus sp. Biocide at 0.1 ppm maintained the systems clean for up to 30 days, and at 1 or 10 ppm for 400 days. After 400 days, the biomass (dry weight) from non-additive-containing diesel in control, 1 and 10 ppm biocide-containing systems was 24.6, 4.6 and 3.3 mg, respectively. The system treated with 0.1 ppm biocide yielded 38.2 mg biomass, indicating that sub-effective doses may lead to increased microbial growth.

Due to the chemical structure of methyl ester, long-term storage may lead to the degradation of fuel properties that can make it difficult to meet the EN 14214 Standard. This paper examines the degradation of several biofuels (sunflower methyl esters, used cooking oil methyl esters and blends with commercial diesel) under different storage conditions over a 6-month period. The storage conditions simulated real-life conditions by using similar temperatures to those found in commercial tanks, with little air turnover and in the absence of light. Extreme temperature conditions were also studied to determine if this variable has an effect on storage stability. Opaque glass or stainless steel storage containers were used to check the interaction between metal and biofuel. The results show that temperature plays an important role in the degradation of methyl esters. On the other hand, stainless steel was found to be a suitable material for the commercial storage tanks as the effect of this material on stability was almost negligible. The blends with commercial diesel performed better in long-term storage. This was probably due to the effect of the ester dilution and the presence of additives in commercial diesel.\n\n==\n\nMu\u017e\u00edkov\u00e1 2022:\n\nTitle: Oxidation stability of diesel fuel during storage\n\nAbstract: Over the last 25 years, the diesel fuel has undergone major changes in its composition, which have fundamentally affected its long-term storage possibilities. An oxidation stability is a main parameter characterising the storage of the diesel fuel and it is strongly affected by a diesel fuel composition. The oxidation stability decreases in a line saturated hydrocarbons \u2013 aromatic hydrocarbons \u2013 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The mandatory use of FAME as a biocomponent of the diesel fuel negatively affect its oxidation stability. The FAME contain unstable double bonds C=C and their mixtures with mineral diesel fuel cannot be storage for a long time. The use of antioxidants with FAME has not effect in the long time storage. A recommended usable life of diesel fuel with FAME accor-ding to \u010cSN 65 6500 is from 1 to 3 months according to the FAME content. However, in some cases it is ne-cessary to store diesel fuel for a long time. State material reserves or back-up diesel generators are examples, when the diesel fuel is stored for the long time.\nThe oxidation stability of the fuel expresses a resistance to an oxygen action. The oxygen, which is dissolved in the fuel, attacts molecules of the fuel and various oxidation products create. Hydroperoxides are the primary oxidation products. Secondary oxidation reactions give aldehydes, ketones, karboxylic acids and insoluble deposits. The oxidation products negatively affect the diesel fuel properties.\nBesides the composition the oxidation stability of the fuel is negatively affected by a high temperature,a high content of dissolved oxygen, an UV radiation and a presence of metals with a catalytic effect.\nAn overview of methods used for the measuring or the observing oxidation stability was prepared in the article. It means not only the oxidation stability measuring but also a measuring of the content of different oxidation products which are related to the various oxidation degree .\nThe aim of the article was to summarize the possibilities of a predicting the storage time of the diesel fuel and to propose a procedure for the monitoring and the predicting its longterm durability. Only one standardized storage test according to the ASTM D4625 can be found in the literature. The test is based on the storage of 400 ml of the diesel fuel at 43 \u00b0C for periods of 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. After aging for a selected period, a sample is analyzed for insolubles. The correlation of the test results is: a week at 43 \u00b0C is roughly equivalent to a month of the storage at the temperature of 21 \u00b0C. The test is a time and material consuming and the correaltion was determined for diesel fuels made up to 1990\u00b4s.\nThe new shorter storage test based on the standard test according to ASTM D4625 was proposed to predict diesel storage stability. The temperature was rised and the the time was shortened up to one month. During the test short laboratory analyses can be used for monitoring oxidation of the diesel fuel for example: the oxidation stability by PetroOxy, the peroxide number, the oxidation index by infrared spectroscopy, the acid number, the bromine number or the antioxidant content. The sample consumption is about 100 ml according to the selected analyses.\n\n==\n\nBezergianni 2012:\n\nTitle: Oxidative stability of waste cooking oil and white diesel upon storage at room temperature.\n\nAbstract: Renewable diesel fuels are alternative fuels produced from vegetable oils or animal fats. Catalytic hydrotreating of waste cooking oil (WCO) was carried out at pilot-plant scale and a paraffinic diesel, called \"white\" diesel was obtained. The white diesel and WCO samples were stored for one year at room temperature under normal atmospheric conditions, but not exposed to sunlight. Viscosity, total acid number (TAN), induction period (IP), carbonaceous deposits, density, cold flow properties, distillation and water content were monitored. TAN and density of the white diesel stored in conventional bottles changed from 0 to 0.221 mg KOH/g and from 787 to 838 kg/m(3), respectively. The remaining parameters did not vary significantly. Water content of WCO increased from 482 to 2491 mg/kg, TAN from 0.744 to 0.931 mg KOH/g, whereas viscosity, IP and carbon residues fluctuated mildly. The results are indicative of the white diesel's stability, rendering it suitable for prolonged storage.\n\n==\n\nBondioli 2004:\n\nTitle: The prediction of biodiesel storage stability. Proposal for a quick test\n\nAbstract: The results obtained during the set-up of a method for the prediction of biodiesel storage stability are shown. In order to speed up the rate of ageing processes, the test temperature was set to 80 \u00b0C, and tests were carried out within 24 h in a Rancimat modified cell apparatus. The effect of the quick ageing process can be monitored by means of the evaluation of changes in ester content, polymer content and peroxide value. By comparing the results obtained during a 1 -year experiment, carried out under real storage conditions, and during a second test, carried out at 43 \u00b0C for 24 wk according to ASTM D 4625 method, with the ones reported in this paper, several discrepancies regarding the different degradation reactions as well as the rate at which these reactions take place were evidenced. Finally, a tentative relationship between the results obtained with the proposed quick test and the real Rancimat induction period, shown by different samples after 12 months of real storage, are shown. From the results obtained during this work, the Oxidation Stability test carried out according to EN 14112:2003 and the Storage Stability test reported herein may provide different information for the evaluation of the overall stability of a biodiesel sample.\n\n==\n\nThompson 2013:\n\nTitle: Long term storage of biodiesel/petrol diesel blends in polyethylene fuel tanks\n\nAbstract: Abstract This paper explores the long-term effects that an ageing biodiesel fuel blended with low sulfur diesel fuel at concentrations of 0%, 15%, 50%, 85%, and 100% (v/v) can have on polyethylene materials. Rotationally molded fuel tanks made of linear low density polyethylene or crosslinked polyethylene were used to appropriately mimic the storage environment of fuels, though the study also considered immersed polymer specimens as this test approach is more commonly reported on in the literature. The extent of oxidation for the fuels was monitored by determination of its peroxide value and acid number over time, with both values being consistently higher for blends with higher biodiesel content. Storage at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for up to 56\u00a0days resulted in significant oxidation of the fuel while testing up to 380\u00a0days at 23\u00a0\u00b0C produced no change in peroxide or acid concentration. The change in mechanical properties for the polyethylenes due to fuel was determined by tensile testing. Comparing the tensile data to the oxidation species in the stored fuels revealed that noted mechanical losses did not correspond with higher concentration of hydroperoxides or acid species but rather occurred as a result of fuel absorption. No difference was found in this regards between the two polyethylene species.\n\n==\n\nMittelbach 2001:\n\nTitle: Long storage stability of biodiesel made from rapeseed and used frying oil\n\nAbstract: The degree of physical and chemical deterioration of biodiesel produced from rapeseed and used frying oil was studied under different storage conditions. These produced drastic effects when the fuel was exposed to daylight and air. However, there were no significant differences between undistilled biodiesel made from fresh rapeseed oil and used frying oil. The viscosity and neutralization numbers rose during storage owing to the formation of dimers and polymers and to hydrolytic cleavage of methyl esters into fatty acids. However, even for samples studied under different storage conditions for over 150 d the specified limits for viscosity and neutralization numbers had not been reached. In European biodiesel specifications there will be a mandatory limit for oxidative stability, because it may be a crucial parameter for injection pump performance. The value for the induction period of the distilled product was very low. The induction period values for the undistilled samples decreased very rapidly during storage, especially with exposure to light and air.", "final_summary": "The longevity of diesel fuel in storage is a topic of considerable interest and has been explored in numerous studies. The consensus among these studies is that the storage life of diesel fuel can vary significantly, depending largely on the specific conditions and the type of diesel fuel in question.\n\nLepera (1973) found that diesel fuels meeting certain federal specifications could maintain satisfactory storage stability for up to two years, although some fuels showed signs of increasing instability over time. Bento (2001) found that diesel fuel could remain stable for up to 30 days with the use of a biocide, but without it, microbial growth could lead to degradation. \n\nBerrios (2012) found that temperature played a significant role in the degradation of methyl esters, a type of biodiesel, over a 6-month storage period. Mu\u017e\u00edkov\u00e1 (2022) suggested that the oxidation stability of diesel fuel, which is crucial for long-term storage, has been negatively affected by changes in its composition over the past 25 years. \n\nBezergianni (2012) found that a type of paraffinic diesel, known as \"white\" diesel, remained stable for a year when stored at room temperature. Bondioli (2004) proposed a quick test for predicting biodiesel storage stability, suggesting that different tests may provide different information about a biodiesel sample's overall stability. \n\nThompson (2013) found that the oxidation of biodiesel fuel blends stored in polyethylene fuel tanks did not result in significant changes in peroxide or acid concentration over a 380-day period at 23\u00b0C. Lastly, Mittelbach (2001) found that biodiesel made from rapeseed and used frying oil remained within specified limits for viscosity and neutralization numbers even after 150 days of storage under various conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the storage life of diesel fuel can range from a month to a few years, depending on the type of diesel, the storage conditions, and the use of stabilizing agents. However, changes in diesel composition over time and the potential for microbial growth and oxidation can negatively impact storage stability. Therefore, regular monitoring and appropriate storage practices are crucial for maintaining the quality of stored diesel fuel."}, {"query": "Critical discussion of the influence of technological, environmental, social and economic determinates on business model transformation (BMT) towards sustainable business model.", "paper_list_string": "Arifiani 2021:\n\nTitle: Environmental Turbulence Capability Sparks Firm Performance by Embracing Business Model Transformation: An Empirical Study on the Internet Industry in Indonesia\n\nAbstract: This study assesses solutions to several questions regarding the effect of Environmental Turbulence on Firm Performance directly and indirectly through Business Model Transformation on Internet Service Provider Companies in Indonesia. The research approach used is an explanatory survey, verification research with a quantitative approach by measuring a sample of variables built on the population's constructs representing 239 companies. The author finds that novelty B.M. transformation design is significantly related to what factors drive the business transformation. Although, this study also finds that BMT positively mediates the relationship between environmental turbulence to influence performance. Environmental turbulence alone is no longer adequate, and organizations need to revamp the B.M. to achieve firm performance. This study also contributed to the movement of research trends targeted at B.M. Transformation. This study provides an appropriate riposte for quantitative empirical studies that elucidate the correlation between BMT on company performance by simultaneously embracing and managing environmental turbulence. The relationship between BMT and the factors that support it will be higher comprehend when contextualized. The author locates different designs and impacts of BMT on business transformation results that culminate in firm business performance since it faces an uncertain business environment that grows dynamically. Although this novelty is important, the authors found no support for effectiveness.

Technological developments and changing patterns of customer demand severely shorten the live spans of the prevailing business models. In order to survive and expand in such turbulent environments, firms must constantly question their established routines and processes. However, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are alarmingly unaware of the business model concept and dedicate little attention to business model innovations (BMIs). As a starting point to overcome this challenge, it is crucially important to accurately identify both, the environmental factors that necessitate business model changes, and the internal firm capabilities to conduct them. \n \nBy referring to the Dynamic Capabilities View (DCV) literature as well as to the largely case study driven literature stream on business model innovations, the study in hand recognizes seven potential influence factors for business model transformations in incumbent SMEs. To empirically verify these factors, an internet-mediated, quantitative survey among executive managers of 89 German SMEs (net response rate: 10.80\\%) was conducted. Subsequently, the resulting data was analyzed using a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS-R) approach to handle multicollinearity related problems. \n \nThe results indicate that four factors, namely, Strategic Sensitivity, Resource Fluidity, Market Turbulence and Technological Turbulence, are significantly related to the degree of Business Model Innovativeness for at least one size class of firms (differentiating micro, small and medium sized firms). Given the lack of quantitative studies in the field, this thesis contributes to the literature by supplying empirical findings that are not limited to certain cases or specific industries. Also, the originality of this work is expressed by the fact that it is the first to empirically conceptualize environmental turbulence in the context of business model innovation.\n\n==\n\nShah 2020:\n\nTitle: Transformation towards Sustainable Business Models in Production\n\nAbstract: A global transformation from Industry 4.0 towards Industry 5.0 will soon take place. Such transformations are intrinsic to human and sustainable value creation. An increasing number of companies, recognising this imminent trend, will need to transform their current classical, solely profit-oriented business models into sustainable business models that also target human, social, and environmental aspects. Various frameworks already exist that support the design of sustainable business models. Practical applications of these frameworks and research on the transformation process in the production domain, which places a special focus on small and medium enterprises, is still scarce. This paper presents the first results from a sustainable business model transformation project on a European SME, which produces 3D printers. The research method applies a single case study design. The study was based on publicly available information and qualitative data, obtained through interviews and workshops carried out on an executive management level.\n\n==\n\nM\u00fcller 2014:\n\nTitle: Business transformation towards sustainability\n\nAbstract: Sustainability is becoming increasingly important in today\u2019s corporate world and can contribute to the current and future success of organizations. Integrating ecological, social, and economic objectives into corporate decisions is a key success factor for transformation towards sustainability. As sustainability is not achieved by single actions, but rather is an on-going process, decision-makers must have means to analyze the current state of an organization. For this, we first illustrate how companies can structure the field of action for the transformation towards sustainability. Furthermore, we propose a decision model to determine how sustainability actions should be implemented in accordance with the paradigm of value-based management, i.e., considering their economic effects. We illustrate the application of the approach using the example of a German medium-sized company.Executive summaryRecently, organizations have recognized sustainability as an emerging mega-trend and as an increasingly important strategic goal. Its integration into the business model can be a key success factor, but also a challenge that requires a systematic approach. In order to comprehensively steer corporate sustainability, with the aim of minimizing negative externalities while maximizing positive effects, companies first need to structure their processes to achieve transparency on where sustainability actions can be incorporated. By furthermore considering the three dimensions of sustainability, possible starting points for sustainability actions can be identified. These two perspectives are complemented by adapting the basic idea of stages of development and maturity to sustainability context, as a way to capture the progress of sustainability actions within each corporate activity. The resulting \u201cSustainability Maturity Cube\u201d serves as a blueprint, i.e., a first generic approach, of how an organization can structure the field of action for the transformation towards sustainability. Considering the paradigm of value-based management in business context, economic effects of the transformation towards sustainability have to be regarded. We therefore, also propose a decision model, which allows aligning ecological, social and economic objectives in order to draw economically useful conclusions by determining the optimal increase of the sustainability maturity level. To evaluate whether our approach proves useful for subject matter experts who are involved in sustainability decisions, we provide a first example of how a specific company can transform towards sustainability.\n\n==\n\nGorissen 2016:\n\nTitle: Transition Thinking and Business Model Innovation\u2013Towards a Transformative Business Model and New Role for the Reuse Centers of Limburg, Belgium\n\nAbstract: The current dynamics of change, including climate change, resource depletion, energy transition, internet of things, etc. will have substantial impacts on the functioning of contemporary business models. Most firms and companies, however, still largely focus on efficiency strategies leading to sub-optimal solutions (reducing bad impact), rather than radically changing their business model to develop new transaction models more appropriate for today\u2019s world (doing better things). However, persistent sustainability issues arising from our changing societal systems, require more radical and structural changes both within and between organizations to change the way we do business. There is limited empirically established research literature on how businesses can be more proactive in this regard and how they can move beyond \u201cmanagement of unsustainability\u201d. In this paper, we present a transformative business model innovation approach inspired by transition theory combining elements of systems thinking, value-inspired envisioning, reflexive design and co-creation that was pioneered for a consortia of reuse centers in the province of Limburg, Belgium. We demonstrate that this approach contributed to the development of new business model concepts, was conducive for mobilizing support and resources to ensure follow up activity and holds potential to promote a more proactive role for businesses as agents of transformative change.\n\n==\n\nSchneider 2018:\n\nTitle: Challenges of transforming a Business Model to a Sustainable Business Model - A case study based on IKEA and Tetra Pak\n\nAbstract: Climate change, poverty, inequality and the increase of strict regulations - these are just a few \nof the factors contributing to the rise of sustainability in today\u2019s corporate environment. As \nsociety and the worldwide population are affected by these omnipresent changes, it becomes \ninevitable for companies to transform their business models in order to respond to demands \nconcerning sustainability. However, this process implies challenges that have so far not been \nfurther examined by literature - neither have the actions that companies need to implement to \novercome them.

The research question was: How is a business model of an incumbent, businessto-business company adapted through the inclusion of environmental sustainability measures, with the customer\u2019s involvement? Methodology/Methods: A qualitative research approach, drawing on a descriptive-explanatory, single case study conducted on a Czech manufacturing company active in the field of steel processing was performed. The study draws on the analysis of the focal company\u2019s internal and external documents related to sustainability, as well as on semi-structured interviews with the examined company\u2019s executives. The analysis also include the externally available sustainability related documents of a dominant customer. Scientific Aim: Understanding the impact of the environment-related sustainability measures on the adaptation of the extant BM of the focal company, and the role a dominant customer plays in the process. Findings: The inclusion of environment-related sustainability measures leads to an adaptation of the process and the product, as well as of the focal company\u2019s BM and most of its key elements. A value capture by the focal company has been identified as the mainly affected element of a BM through both cost savings and a more business gained. The element value proposition adapts towards a \u201cgreener company\u201d. The core logic of the BM remains unchanged. Conclusions: B2B incumbent companies implement environmental sustainability measures into their BMs, aiming to contribute to the preservation of the environment. The economic side continues to be carefully considered. It can even be a trigger of implementation. The large customers get strongly involved in the process, contributing to the adaptation of all four key elements of the BM. The BM\u2019s adaptation happens dynamically, in incremental steps.\n\n==\n\nStubbs 2008:\n\nTitle: Conceptualizing a \u201cSustainability Business Model\u201d\n\nAbstract: According to one perspective, organizations will only be sustainable if the dominant neoclassical model of the firm is transformed, rather than supplemented, by social and environmental priorities.

Companies worldwide are using the web to provide personalized offerings and unique experiences to their customers. While there is a lot of hype about delivering personalized services over the web, little is known about the effectiveness of web personalization and the link between the IT artifact (the personalization agent) and the effects it exerts on a user's information processing and decision making. To address the impact of personalized content, this article theoretically develops and empirically tests a model of web personalization. The model is grounded on social cognition and consumer research theories adapted to the peculiar features of web personalization. The influence of a personalization agent is mediated by two variables: content relevance and self reference. Hypotheses generated from the model are empirically tested in a laboratory experiment and a field study. The findings indicate that content relevance, self reference, and goal specificity affect the attention, cognitive processes, and decisions of web users in various ways. Also, users are found to be receptive to personalized content and find it useful as a decision aid. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.\n\n==\n\nMadeira 2012:\n\nTitle: Personalization in pervasive spaces towards smart interactions design\n\nAbstract: Pervasive Computing is not yet fully realized, presenting critical challenges such as obtaining and choosing the relevant content and interfaces for user interaction, which is a hard task in many applications from diverse domains.

However, more and more services need to know the user for providing services or for presenting the user to other us-ers. An important functionality in this context is personalization. To perform personalization identification and exchange of user profiles has to be per-formed on the Internet. In this paper we argue that user-centric global iden-tity management is needed for personalization to spread. We present the current state of work in the area of identity management, discuss needs and possibilities for future developments, and show some results of the work we have done in this context. 1 Personalization Personalization is increasingly considered to be an important ingredient of Web appli-cations. In most cases personalization techniques are used for tailoring information services to personal user needs. In marketing, personalization supports one-to-one marketing which should increase the customer share over a lifetime. What used to be possible in the corner shop, since the shopkeeper knew her customers personally, will be extensively possible in the electronic medium by the storage of profiles and the automatic evaluation on the basis of predefined rules. With the use of electronic media, the advantages of mass production (the same online-shop and the same product data-base for all customers) are harnessed to the strengths of individual production (per-sonalized website) [Schubert/Koch 2002]. Technically, personalization is about selecting or filtering information objects or prod-ucts for an individual by using information about the individual (her customer profile). Different methods are known for performing this selection. These methods range from content based filtering with rules or vector similarities to automated collaborative filter-ing (see [Schubert/Koch 2002] and [Koch/Schubert 2002] for more information). But in-dependently of the personalization method the ability to deliver personalization is al-ways based on the acquisition of a picture of the user. Depending on the personaliza-tion method used, there are different requirements to the representation of this picture. For content based filtering information about preferred content and relationships to con-tent objects has to be stored. For collaborative filtering relationships to other users and ratings have to be managed.\n\n==\n\nKim 2002:\n\nTitle: Personalization: Definition, Status, and Challenges Ahead\n\nAbstract: As is often the case with a good marketing buzzword, the term personalization is used rather loosely today. It has come to stand for an ultimate goal of customer relationship management by businesses. It has also come to mean delivery of information of high relevance to an individual. In any case, given the huge and rapidly growing amounts of computerized information, and the unprecedented level of competition for customers, personalization is one of the most important trends in data processing and businesses.

Its purpose is to adapt a standardized product or service to an individual customer's needs. The goal is to create profit for the producer and increased value for the consumer. This goal fits nicely into traditional notions of segmentation. Applications of personalization have advanced greatly in conjunction with the Internet, since it provides an environment that is information rich and well suited to interactivity. This article reviews past research on personalization and considers some examples of personalization in practice. We discuss what we believe are key problems and directions for personalization in the future.", "final_summary": "Personalization, defined as the process of tailoring services or products to individual user's needs, is a concept that is becoming increasingly prevalent in our digital age (Kim, 2002). This prevalence is a key component of an interactive marketing strategy, aiming to create profit for the producer and increased value for the consumer (Montgomery, 2009).\n\nThe proliferation of new electronic technologies has led to a connected world where personalization is becoming more integral (Lewis, 2004). This is particularly evident in the context of ambient network intelligence, which is focused on identifying individual users and providing them with intelligent personalized assistance based on their specific needs and contexts (Lewis, 2004).\n\nWeb personalization is another area where personalization is becoming more common, with companies worldwide using the web to provide personalized offerings to their customers (Tam, 2006). The effectiveness of web personalization is linked to the IT artifact and its effects on a user's information processing and decision making (Tam, 2006).\n\nIn the realm of news consumption, personalization is resulting in an increasing number of editorial decisions being taken by computer algorithms and end users (Thurman, 2011). This has implications for debates on news consumption, content diversity, and the economic context for journalism (Thurman, 2011).\n\nPersonalization is also becoming more prevalent in pervasive computing spaces, presenting challenges such as obtaining and choosing relevant content and interfaces for user interaction (Madeira, 2012).\n\nThe concept of personalization is integrated into the online marketing mix, providing a guideline for planning personalization activities (Riemer, 2003).

However, the responsibility of populating the repository with relevant and high quality data required for customized data analyses is spread across workgroups associated with specific business processes. In an information interdependent setting, factors such as short-term organizational focus and the lack of uniformity in information management skills across workgroups can act as impediments to information sharing. Using an analytical model of information exchange between two workgroups, we study the impact of measures (e.g., creating a perception of continuity and persistence in interactions, benefit sharing, etc.) on the performance of the workgroups and the organization. The model considers a setting we describe as information complementarity, where the payoff to a workgroup depends not only on the quality of its own information, but also on that of the information provided by other workgroups. We show how a long-term vision combined with homogeneity in information management capabilities across workgroups can lead to organizationally desirable levels of information exchange, and how benefit sharing can either help or hurt individual and organizational information exchange outcomes under different circumstances. Our analysis highlights the need for appropriate organizational enablers to realize the benefits of enterprise systems and related applications.\n\n==\n\nAviram 2010:\n\nTitle: Overcoming Impediments to Information Sharing\n\nAbstract: When deciding whether to share information, firms consider their private welfare. Discrepancies between social and private welfare may lead firms excessively to share information to anti-competitive ends - in facilitating of cartels and other harmful horizontal practices - a problem both antitrust scholarship and case law have paid much attention to. On the other hand, legal scholars have paid far less attention to the opposite type of inefficiency in information sharing among competitors - namely, the problem of sub-optimal information sharing. This phenomenon can generate significant social costs and is of special importance in network industries because the maintenance of compatibility, a key to producing positive network effects, typically requires information sharing. Understanding the hitherto neglected impact of sub-optimal information sharing is important not only for many areas of antitrust law, but also for developing effective policies towards network industries and critical infrastructures more generally, as well as for improving those procedural rules that concern information exchange among litigating parties. This paper therefore advances the legal analysis of impediments to efficient information sharing in a number of significant ways: First, it shows that the strategic behavior of competitors may erect an economic barrier to information sharing that has not been previously addressed in the literature - the fear of degradation. This form of strategic behavior involves the strategic refusal to share information when the refusal inflicts a greater harm on one's rivals than on oneself, and thus generates a competitive advantage. Second, the paper reveals a hitherto unrecognized set of behavioral impediments to information sharing, wherein rivalry norms and managers' risk attitudes bias competitors' judgments of the prospects of information sharing and the status-quo bias and ambiguity aversion lead these decision makers to avoid such arrangements. Third, it integrates these economic and behavioral insights with the findings of the extant literature to create a new framework for predicting when private information sharing will be suboptimal. Finally, we suggest how the alignment of private information sharing with social optimality may be promoted, based on the framework developed here.\n\n==\n\nLage 2012:\n\nTitle: Factors Influencing Information Sharing in Four SME Networks in Portugal - A Coordination Perspective\n\nAbstract: Sharing a minimum amount of information is a basic condition for working in cooperation.

Sharing information across different physical organisations, working as a single virtual organisation, raises a number of information security issues that limit the effectiveness, dynamism, and potential of collaborative working. Although extensive research has been conducted to provide secure information-sharing solutions within a single organisation, little research has investigated multi- organizational information-sharing environments where information requires to be protected but there are variations in information security needs and, in some cases, conflicts in applied information security controls. A key obstacle, the majority of research conducted in this area has overlooked, is not only the ability to govern remote access of users from one organisation to sensitive information stored in another organisation, but also having persistent control over owned information even after access has been granted and the information is either disseminated electronically, transformed into paper format, or even shared verbally. In addition, research was tailored to meet only specific research needs and address particular issues. Therefore, there is a lack of comprehensive, systematic approaches for controls on information usage shared electronically, regardless of specific circumstances. This paper aims to present a novel information control model that could keep information self-protected in dynamic collaborative environments by communicating information security needs along with the exchanged information using an Information Labelling Scheme. Based on SPIDER solution and Protective Commons, this scheme uses nine labelling icons (reflecting the protection type and level) associated with different information security controls (representing the information security mechanisms used to provide the protection). The model is demonstrated in the Microsoft Word 2007 application and a prototype has been developed as a plug-in software named Information Labelling Palette. It displays the nine self-explanatory icons in order for an information owner/user to label any information range within a single document using any icon. This consequently enforces the information security controls associated with the selected icon only into that particular range of electronic information, and secondly, communicates the information security needs to the recipient in a human-readable format, which would help keep recipients informed about how this information should be managed if printed out or shared verbally. Finally, the wide range of information security controls used in this proposed solution makes it widely applicable to meet the considerable diversity of organisations\u2019 information security needs. Furthermore, it is believed to lay a solid foundation for future work in the area of information access control and control policy enforcement in collaborative environments.\n\n==\n\nBata 2020:\n\nTitle: Information Sharing Behaviour of Complex and Extended Organisations\n\nAbstract: The information sharing behaviours observed in extended organisations involve the use of dedicated specialised teams and groups. This study presents theoretical evidence, drawing on Activity Theory as an analytical lens, linking specialised teams in such complex and extended organisations to conditions which may lead to information sharing failures. These failures are apparent through tensions and contradictions examined in the activity system which helped in identifying failures in the formal systems and emergent behaviours to (or \u201cintending to\u201d) resolve them. Results from this study show that information sharing behaviours in an extended organisation are driven in part at least by the team\u2019s need and ability to share information with members of the team (formed to) dealing with an information sharing failure resulting in an organisational problem and aimed at achieving a common shared goal in the relationship. There is an established link showing that information sharing in the setting supports and enhances the exchange of ideas and information between partners due to the complementing needs of services thus helping in reducing extension problems and, thereby, providing a coping strategy for the central organisation. Amongst the importance of information sharing in the setting is the ability to forecast uncertainties as a result of better understanding of each partner\u2019s capabilities and strength. Complexity was observed to be a factor that triggers information sharing failure in extended relationships and dependencies. This occurs when there is no congruence between information deliveries amongst all the collaborating partners.\n\n==\n\nJahanyan 2011:\n\nTitle: Factors influencing on knowledge-sharing behaviour in organisations\n\nAbstract: In this paper, using structural equation modelling, significance of relationships between the affecting factors and knowledge-sharing behaviour was examined. To test the proposed model of research, an Iranian leading company in the field of ICT was selected. Using the structural model as an output of data analysis, the significant influentive constructs of model were identified. According to the results of data analysis, it was clear that Managerial Factors (MFs) and Personality Traits (PTs) have significant influence on knowledge-sharing behaviour in the organisation.\n\n==\n\nYang 2011:\n\nTitle: Information-sharing in public organizations: A literature review of interpersonal, intra-organizational and inter-organizational success factors\n\nAbstract: Abstract Information sharing is considered an important approach to increasing organizational efficiency and performance. With advances in information and communication technology, sharing information across organizations has become more feasible. In the public sector, government agencies are also aware of the importance of information sharing for addressing policy issues such as anti-terrorism and public health. However, information sharing can be a complex task. Identifying factors that influence information sharing is critical. In the literature, research in information sharing focuses on the interpersonal, intra-organizational, and inter-organizational levels. This paper reviews the current information-sharing research, discusses the factors affecting information sharing at the three levels, and provides summative frameworks. These frameworks provide a means to discover future research opportunities, and a systematic way for practitioners to identify key factors involved in successful information sharing.\n\n==\n\nHart 2006:\n\nTitle: Comparing Cultural and Political Perspectives of Data, Information, and Knowledge Sharing in Organisations\n\nAbstract: This paper raises issues concerning data, information, and knowledge sharing in organisations and, in particular, compares an organisational cultural analysis of why such sharing is often difficult to achieve with an organisational political one. The issues raised are often insufficiently attended to by practitioners who are attempting to build technological information and knowledge management systems. The driver for the paper is that despite impressive advances in technology and its now almost ubiquitous presence in organisations, as well as academic study over several decades, many of the benefits originally expected concerning improved data, information, and knowledge sharing have not materialised as expected. Basic reasons for this lie in the lack of attention to the cultural foundations of organisations and because matters relating to organisational power and political matters are often misunderstood, overlooked, or ignored. These different perspectives are discussed and contrasted in order to tease out the important differences between them and assess the prospects for a synthesis. It is concluded that while there are important commonalities between the two perspectives there are also fundamental differences, notably regarding what are causes and what are effects and, therefore, how to go about effecting change regarding data, information, and knowledge sharing.", "final_summary": "Information sharing in organisations is a complex process influenced by a myriad of factors. Barua (2007) highlights that short-term organisational focus and lack of uniformity in information management skills can hinder information sharing. Similarly, Aviram (2010) identifies strategic behaviour, such as the fear of degradation, and behavioural impediments, including rivalry norms and managers' risk attitudes, as significant barriers to information sharing. \n\nLage (2012) adds to this by suggesting that factors such as information quality, top management commitment, trust, network coordination\u2019s role, reciprocity, and age influence information sharing within inter-organisational networks. Alsalamah (2010) points out that security issues can limit the effectiveness of information sharing in multi-organisational environments. \n\nBata (2020) links information sharing failures to the use of specialised teams in complex and extended organisations. Jahanyan (2011) identifies managerial factors and personality traits as significant influences on knowledge-sharing behaviour, but does not specifically link these to information sharing failures or the use of specialised teams. \n\nYang (2011) reviews the current information-sharing research and discusses the factors affecting information sharing at interpersonal, intra-organisational, and inter-organisational levels, although it does not explicitly state that the review is comprehensive. \n\nLastly, Hart (2006) argues that cultural and political perspectives within organisations can significantly impact data, information, and knowledge sharing. He suggests that the lack of attention to the cultural foundations of organisations and misunderstandings related to organisational power and politics can hinder effective information sharing.\n\nIn conclusion, the factors hindering information sharing in organisations are multifaceted, ranging from managerial and behavioural aspects to cultural and political perspectives. Addressing these barriers requires a comprehensive understanding of the organisational context and the development of strategies that consider these diverse factors."}, {"query": "Time-use homogeneity", "paper_list_string": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Chapela 2006:\n\nTitle: On measuring heterogeneity in the use of time\n\nAbstract: This paper discusses methods that permit evaluating the degree of heterogeneity in the use of time.

Within the international project Assessing Time Use Survey Datasets several potentially useful individual US time use heritage datasets have been identified for use in de-veloping an historical series of non-market accounts. In order to evaluate the series of American Heritage Time Use Data (AHTUD) (1965, 1975, 1985, 1992-94, 1998-99) this paper analyses the representativeness of this data when using given weights and provides a new harmonised calibration of the AHTUD for sound time use analyses. Our calibration procedure with its ADJUST program package is theoretically founded on information theory, consistent with a simultaneous weighting including hierarchical data, ensures desired positive weights, and is well-suited and available for any time use data calibration of interest. We present the calibration approach and provide new harmonised weights for all AHTUD surveys based on a substantially driven calibration frame-work. To illustrate the various application possibilities of a calibration, we finally disentangle demographic vs. time use behavioural changes and developments by re-calibrating all five AHTUD surveys using 1965 popula-tion totals as a benchmark.\n\n==\n\nVagni 2020:\n\nTitle: The social stratification of time use patterns.\n\nAbstract: Time use is both a cause of social inequality and a consequence of social inequality. However, how social class stratifies time use patterns is seldom studied. In this paper, I describe the time use patterns in the years 1983 and 2015 by social class, and\u00a0gender in the British context. Using sequence analysis methods, I show how the diversity of time use patterns in British society is socially stratified. I find that 13 clusters capture the heterogeneity of time use patterns and that these clusters are associated with social class, gender, and day of the week. These clusters capture patterns of paid and unpaid work schedules, as well as leisure patterns. The results show that men have experienced a reduction of the standard Monday to Friday 8-hr working day, while women have experienced a general increase in this type of schedule. On the other hand, patterns of domestic working days have reduced for women and increased for men. Important differences exist in paid and unpaid work patterns between social classes. Working-class women have experienced an important increase in shift work on weekends. They are also much more likely to be doing unpaid work on weekdays compared to upper-class and middle-class women. Working-class men are more likely to experience non-working days and leisure days on both weekdays and weekends and are more likely to be doing shift work. They are also more often doing unpaid work on weekdays compared to men in upper-class households. Patterns of childcare indicate that all families have increased their childcare time. Men in upper-class households in particular have experienced an important growth in childcare time between 1983 and 2015. I conclude by discussing how time use can further our understanding of social stratification.\n\n==\n\nSayer 2016:\n\nTitle: Trends in Women\u2019s and Men\u2019s Time Use, 1965\u20132012: Back to the Future?\n\nAbstract: Women\u2019s and men\u2019s time use is more similar today than it was in the 1960s, when specialization in adult roles was at its peak, but convergence remains stubbornly out of sight. This chapter updates earlier trend studies of time use and finds that recent data confirm the most consistent findings from earlier analyses. The greater similarity of women\u2019s and men\u2019s time use today is due much more to changes among women than among men. Further, despite declines in women\u2019s housework time, the increase in women\u2019s childcare time and paid work time has resulted in a gender gap in leisure time. New findings from this analysis reveal the gender gap in leisure is accounted for by men\u2019s higher levels of television time.\n\n==\n\nFisher 2007:\n\nTitle: Gender Convergence in the American Heritage Time use Study (AHTUS)\n\nAbstract: We present evidence from a new comprehensive database of harmonized national time-diary data that standardizes information on almost 40\u00a0years of daily life in America. The advantages of the diary method over other ways of calculating how time is spent are reviewed, along with its ability to generate more reliable and accurate measures of productive activity than respondent estimates or other alternatives. We then discuss the various procedures used to develop these harmonized data, both to standardize reporting detail and to match with Census Bureau population characteristics. We then use these data to document historical shifts in Americans\u2019 use of time, particularly focusing on gendered change in paid and unpaid work. We explore these data to find new and more complex evidence of continuing gender convergence, not just in aggregated totals of hours worked, but also in (1) the distributions of activity through the day and the week, (2) the sorts of activities that marital partners do together, as well as (3) the processes of construction of the diary accounts themselves.\n\n==\n\nKamakura 2009:\n\nTitle: American Time-Styles: A Finite-Mixture Allocation Model for Time-Use Analysis\n\nAbstract: Time-use has already been the subject of numerous studies across multiple disciplines such as economics, marketing, sociology, transportation and urban planning. However, most of this research has focused on comparing demographic groups on a few broadly defined activities (e.g., work for pay, leisure, housework, etc.). In this study we take a holistic perspective, identifying a typology of latent \u201ctime-styles,\u201d that defines the different ways people allocate the 24 hr in a day across multiple competing daily activities. We propose a finite-mixture time-allocation model that accounts for differences in life priorities across individuals, taking into consideration the fact that we all have the same \u201cbudget\u201d of 24 hr to spend every day and that this allocation leads to highly sparse, truncated data. This model is then applied to time-use data from the American Time Use Survey collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2006.\n\n==\n\nGauthier 2000:\n\nTitle: Patterns of time use of people age 55 to 64 years old: Some cross-national comparisons\n\nAbstract: This paper examines the patterns of time use of adults age 55 to 64 years old in six countries: Austria, Canada, Finland, Italy, Sweden, and the United States. It examines the discontinuity in daily activities by employment status and gender.The paper uses nationally representative samples from time use surveys carried out in each country. We compute aggregate patterns of time use by employment status and gender for seven categories of activities: personal activities, paid work, unpaid work, housework, social leisure, active leisure, and passive leisure. We also compute dissimilarity indices to measure the degree of discontinuity in patterns of time use by employment status and gender.We find that the pattern of time use of non-employed adults resemble that of full-time employed people on their non-workdays. We also find evidence that the transition out of the labor force is associated with a convergence in pattern of time use of men and women in the USA, Canada, and Finland, but not in other countries.There appears to be continuities in the way people use their time as they grow older and retire from the labor force. We however raise the possibility that these results may hold only for the `young-old'. Decreasing health and physical endurance at older ages may introduce significant discontinuities in patterns of time at a later stage of the life-cycle. Our future work will examine the impact of health and daily limitation on patterns of time use at older ages.\n\n==\n\nGimenez-Nadal 2012:\n\nTitle: Trends in time allocation: A cross-country analysis\n\nAbstract: Using detailed time-use data for seven industrialized countries from the 1970s until today we document general decreases in men's market work coupled with increases in men's unpaid work and child care, and increases in women's paid work and child care coupled with decreases in unpaid work. We also find almost universal increases in the time devoted to watching television over this period, and uncover a widespread increase in leisure inequality in favor of lower educated adults. Trends in leisure inequality mirror the general increase in income and earnings inequality experienced in most countries over this period, especially after the mid-1980s. All these findings are consistent with previous results for the US. However, in contrast to the increases in leisure found for the US, we fail to find common trends in leisure time across countries over the period analyzed.", "final_summary": "The concept of \"Time-use homogeneity\" delves into the uniformity or diversity in how individuals distribute their time across various activities.

Consequently, when a court hears a case involving the interests of those controlling the executive and legislative institutions, those interests can threaten to obstruct the court's intended outcome. In this paper, we evaluate whether and to what extent such constraints shape judicial rulings. Specifically, we examine how threats of noncompliance and legislative override influence decisions by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Based on a statistical analysis of a novel dataset of ECJ rulings, we find that the preferences of member-state governments\u2014whose interests are central to threats of noncompliance and override\u2014have a systematic and substantively important impact on ECJ decisions.\n\n==\n\nZink 2009:\n\nTitle: Courting the Public: The Influence of Decision Attributes on Individuals\u2019 Views of Court Opinions\n\nAbstract: Scholars and judges commonly maintain that courts require institutional legitimacy in order to be an effective institution of government and that such legitimacy depends on judges making legally principled, neutral decisions. Two principal ways judges can signal the neutrality of decisions are the size of the majority coalition and the treatment of precedent: opinions with larger majorities or grounded in precedent project to the public that they were decided in accordance with the rule of law and thus based on impartial decision-making criteria. We use an experimental design to test whether these two decision attributes influence attitudes toward decisions, presenting individuals with mock newspaper articles reporting on Court decisions in which we systematically vary majority coalition size and treatment of precedent. Our data show that when the Court produces a unanimous (rather than divided) decisional coalition and when it follows (rather than overrules) precedent, individuals are more likely to agree with and accept a decision, even if they are ideologically predisposed to disagree with a given Court outcome.\n\n==\n\nZinkJames 2015:\n\nTitle: Courting the Public: The Influence of Decision Attributes on Individuals\u2019 Views of Court Opinions\n\nAbstract: Scholars and judges commonly maintain that courts require institutional legitimacy in order to be an effective institution of government and that such legitimacy depends on judges making legally principled, neutral decisions.

Court rulings, therefore, should be demonstrably congruent with the views of the majoritarian electoral/political alliance. Building upon an innovative study by Mishler and Sheehan (1993), the relationship between public and elite attitudes and Supreme Court rulings are examined in two important issue areas: criminal procedure and race- related civil rights. The results indicate that permeability of the Court varies to some degree according to issue area. While public opinion (in the pre- Reagan years) has a direct affect on Supreme Court liberalism in both issue areas, the direct impact of elite opinion is evidenced only in the area of criminal procedure, not in the area of race-related civil rights. The relation ship between public opinion and Court liberalism during the Reagan years, however, is negative as the gap between liberalism in the public \"mood\" and in Court decisions has widened. These nuances in the relationship between the Supreme Court and the broader sociopolitical environment indicate that the Court does follow changes in the dominant political alliance more readily in some issue areas than it does in others.\n\n==\n\nGibson 2010:\n\nTitle: Can Judicial Symbols Produce Persuasion and Acquiescence? Testing a Micro-Level Model of the Effects of Court Legitimacy*\n\nAbstract: How is it that the United State Supreme Court \u2013 perhaps the least majoritarian of all American political institutions \u2013 is capable of getting most citizens to accept rulings with which they disagree? This analysis addresses the role of the symbols of judicial authority and legitimacy \u2013 the robe, the gavel, the cathedrallike court building \u2013 in contributing to this willingness of ordinary citizens to acquiesce to disagreeable court. Based on an experimental design, our analysis shows that the mere exposure to seemingly innocuous symbols of judicial power increases the likelihood of acquiescence. The effect is not strong, but neither are the symbols we use in the experimental treatment. Additional analysis reveals that the consequences of judicial symbols vary with factors such as the intensity of initial policy attitudes, knowledge of the judiciary, and independent measures of institutional support for the Supreme Court. We understand these various empirical findings with the assistance of three bodies of theory: Legitimacy Theory, Positivity Theory, and the Theory of Motivated Political Reasoning. The Theory of Motivated Political Reasoning explains how non-conscious stimuli such as background symbols can affect the reasoning of ordinary citizens, providing the micro-level underpinning for the asymmetrical effects of exposure to the judiciary that is addressed by Positivity Theory. Because symbols influence citizens, and influence them in ways that reinforce the legitimacy of courts, the connection between institutional attitudes and acquiescence posited by Legitimacy Theory is both supported and explained.\n\n==\n\nAshenfelter 1995:\n\nTitle: Politics and the Judiciary: The Influence of Judicial Background on Case Outcomes\n\nAbstract: It is widely believed that the background and worldview of judges influence their decisions. This article uses the fact that judges are assigned their cases randomly to assess the effect of judicial background on the outcome of cases from the day-to-day docket in three federal trial courts. Unlike the political science findings of ideological influence in published opinions, we find little evidence that judges differ in their decisions with respect to the mass of case outcomes.

These arguments are evaluated using the variation in political backgrounds on a constitutional court, Chile\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal, using case-level and vote-level data from 1990 until 2010. The analysis shows that the rate of dissent rises after major reforms to the powers and judicial selection mechanism of the Tribunal in 2005 and that the dissent rate corresponds to periods of greater partisanship on the court. Further, decisions regarding the unconstitutionality of laws intensify the propensity to dissent at both the case and judge level. In further examination of variation across judges\u2019 voting records, judges who have identifiable partisan associations of any kind are generally more likely to dissent than those with limited political backgrounds.\n\n==\n\nGoldman 1969:\n\nTitle: Backgrounds, Attitudes and the Voting Behavior of Judges: A Comment on Joel Grossman's Social Backgrounds and Judicial Decisions\n\nAbstract: SHELDON GOLDMAN University of Massackusetts T HE DIALOGUE WITHIN the profession concerning judicial behavior research has generally moved from disapproving polemic to sympathetic indeed constructive criticism.

In spite of these diverse definitions, intersectionality has been central to the study of inequality, identity and power relations in recent history (Cho et al., 2013), highlighting the inseparability of categories of social differences such as race, gender, class, ethnicity, sexuality and nation, and calling attention to the systemic power dynamics that arise as multiple dimensions of social difference interact across individual, institutional, cultural and societal spheres of influence (Collins, 2000; McCall, 2005; Yuval-Davis, 2006, 2011; Weber, 2010).

Intersectionality research is defined principally by its focus on the simultaneous and interactive effects of race, gender, class, sexual orientation, and national origin as categories of difference in the United States and beyond. This symposium is a conscious attempt to draw on our expertise in intersectionality and our identities as political scientists to spotlight different approaches to intersectionality. Part of our goal is thus to facilitate the development of innovative theoretical arguments and new empirical research designs in this area of scholarship by featuring examples of intersectionality research from distinct subfields. The essays that follow this introduction speak to a broad audience, as they represent four distinct subfields: political theory, American politics, comparative politics, and public policy. Each essay addresses the growing body of research focusing on what Dara Strolovitch (2007) calls intersectionally stigmatized populations at different levels of analysis. Each article also brings the tools of political science to bear on topics ripe for intersectional analysis, again reinforcing the notion that intersectionality theory and political science have much to offer each other. Much of the early scholarship on intersectionality has focused almost entirely on the United States and is often critiqued as having utility solely in the American context. Later scholarship, in attempting to address this critique, opened another avenue of questions, such as, what happens to a concept when it \"goes global\" and is applied to contexts outside of the United States? Comparative politics scholar Erica Townsend-Bell provides one answer to this question. Her essay, \"What is Relevance? Defining Intersectional Praxis in Uruguay,\" is less focused on intersectionality as a theoretical construct and more concerned with its development as political praxis. Using the 2005 International Women's Day March and the 2003 domestic violence coalition as illustrative examples, she identifies the conditions under which a normative philosophical commitment to intersectionality does not square with its adaption and translation on the ground. Through analysis of field interviews with activists Townsend-Bell attends to the ideological disputes over which identity categories are most relevant to single-issue and multiissue women's organizations in Uruguay. Linking her interests in intersectionality with traditional questions of social movements and group formation, Townsend-Bell exposes real-life circumstances that arise when social movement actors attempt to find the most productive and usable ways of provoking social change collaboratively. Through her critical analysis of intersectionality's applicability in the Uruguayan context, she provides further evidence of the need for intersectional consciousness (Greenwood 2008) prior to movement building, and her essay reminds us that intersectionality as a term travels across time and geographic regions. Like Townsend-Bell, Nancy Wadsworth's essay, \"Intersectionality in California's Same-Sex Marriage Battles: A Complex Proposition,\" also focuses on a longstanding area of interest shared by intersectionality scholars and political scientists: the tensions and limitations of majoritarian efforts to protect the rights of minorities. From a very different political context Wadsworth examines the coalitional and rhetorical strategies used to mobilize support in favor of a ballot initiative in the United States, Proposition 8, which eliminated the right to samesex marriage in California. Wadsworth makes the case for a broader, more inclusive conceptualization of intersectionality, insisting that religion qualifies as yet another identity category of difference. \u2026\n\n==\n\nHarris 2018:\n\nTitle: Un/Doing Intersectionality through Higher Education Research\n\nAbstract: ABSTRACT Grounded in Black feminist and critical race theories, legal scholar Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw introduced the term \u201cintersectionality\u201d to the academy in 1989 to demonstrate how U.S. structures, such as the legal system, and discourses of resistance, such as feminism and anti-racism, often frame identities as isolated and mutually exclusive, resulting in the \u201ctheoretical erasure\u201d of Black women who hold multiple minoritized identities. Since 1989, intersectionality has become a \u201ctraveling theory,\u201d that has crossed into and influenced almost every academic discipline, including higher education. Through this study, we examined how researchers in higher education do and undo intersectionality and, subsequently, how intersectional analyses may advance a radical social justice agenda in higher education. To explore how scholars un/do intersectionality in higher education, we conducted a summative content analysis of 97 higher education articles that used the term \u201cintersectionality\u201d in some manner. The goal of the study was not to offer a prescriptive way to use intersectionality. In fact, theoretically musing over the precise way in which intersectionality should be done may confine the concept to an overly academic contemplative exercise and therefore, undo intersectionality. Instead, through this research, we aimed to explore and use intersectionality in a manner that advances a transformative social justice agenda.\n\n==\n\nGopaldas 2013:\n\nTitle: Intersectionality 101\n\nAbstract: The concept of \u201cintersectionality\u201d refers to the interactivity of social identity structures such as race, class, and gender in fostering life experiences, especially experiences of privilege and oppression. This essay maps out the origins, evolution, and many contemporary meanings of intersectionality to make a notoriously ambiguous idea more concrete. In addition, the author clarifies the tenets of the intersectionality literature by contrasting traditional and intersectional research on marketplace diversity along three dimensions: ontology, methodology, and axiology. The essay concludes with implications for radicalizing diversity research, marketing, and advocacy.\n\n==\n\nHancock 2015:\n\nTitle: Intersectionality: An Intellectual History\n\nAbstract: Intersectionality theory has emerged over the past thirty years as a way to think about the avenues by which inequalities (most often dealing with, but not limited to, race, gender, class and sexuality) are produced. Rather than seeing such categories as signaling distinct identities that can be adopted, imposed or rejected, intersectionality theory considers the logic by which each of these categories is socially constructed as well as how they operate within the diffusion of power relations. In other words, social and political power are conferred through categories of identity, and these identities bear vastly material effects. Rather than look at inequalities as a relationship between those at the center and those on the margins, intersectionality maps the relative ways in which identity politics create power. Though intersectionality theory has emerged as a highly influential school of thought in ethnic studies, gender studies, law, political science, sociology and psychology, no scholarship to date exists on the evolution of the theory. In the absence of a comprehensive intellectual history of the theory, it is often discussed in vague, ahistorical terms. And while scholars have called for greater specificity and attention to the historical foundations of intersectionality theory, their idea of the history to be included is generally limited to the particular currents in the United States. This book seeks to remedy the vagueness and murkiness attributed to intersectionality by attending to the historical, geographical, and cross-disciplinary myopia afflicting current intersectionality scholarship. This comprehensive intellectual history is an agenda-setting work for the theory.\n\n==\n\nGillborn 2015:\n\nTitle: Intersectionality, Critical Race Theory, and the Primacy of Racism\n\nAbstract: The article explores the utility of intersectionality as an aspect of critical race theory (CRT) in education. Drawing on research with Black middle-class parents in England, the article explores the intersecting roles of race, class, and gender in the construction and deployment of dis/ability in education. The author concludes that intersectionality is a vital aspect of understanding race inequity but that racism retains a primacy for critical race scholars in three key ways: namely, empirical primacy (as a central axis of oppression in the everyday reality of schools), personal/autobiographical primacy (as a vital component in how critical race scholars view themselves and their experience of the world), and political primacy (as a point of group coherence and activism).", "final_summary": "Intersectionality, a concept that examines the interplay of social identities such as race, gender, class, and sexuality in shaping life experiences, particularly those of privilege and oppression, has been a pivotal concept in various fields (Gopaldas, 2013). This concept has been central to the study of inequality, identity, and power relations, highlighting the inseparability of these social categories and the systemic power dynamics that arise from their interaction across individual, institutional, cultural, and societal spheres (Rodriguez, 2016).\n\nThe concept of intersectionality has been applied across various fields, including work and organizations (Rodriguez, 2016), higher education (Haynes, 2020; Harris, 2018), and legal systems (Mackinnon, 2013). In the context of higher education, intersectionality has been used as both a theoretical framework and a methodological tool in studies related to Black women (Haynes, 2020).\n\nThe concept of intersectionality has also been instrumental in challenging the traditional framing of identities as isolated and mutually exclusive, thereby addressing the \"theoretical erasure\" of individuals holding multiple minoritized identities (Harris, 2018). It has crossed into and influenced almost every academic discipline, including higher education (Harris, 2018).\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of intersectionality has been pivotal in understanding and addressing the complexities of social identities and power dynamics.

Evaluating Theories on the Salience of Ethnicity in African Electoral Politics\n\nAbstract: The political salience of ethnicity in Africa is well-established, but these identities are by no means the sole determiners of individuals\u2019 political preferences and behaviors, either. Substantial variation exists within and between countries in terms of individuals\u2019 likelihood of voting for co-ethnics. In an attempt to identify factors contributing to this variation, this paper draws upon three theoretical approaches. First, some versions of modernization theory suggest that educated, urbanized voters with greater access to mass media will be more likely to embrace global, rather than parochial, identities, and will therefore be more open to voting across ethnic lines. Second, theories of strategic voting would suggest that the relative size of an individual\u2019s ethnic group should impact tendencies toward ethnic voting. Finally, ethnic voting might be more common under some electoral institutions than under others. Hypotheses are tested using data drawn from the third round of the Afrobarometer survey. The dependent variable - ethnic voting - is operationalized according to individuals\u2019 support for the consensus candidate of their ethnic group. The analysis finds support for \u201cclassical\u201d modernization theories, and finds significant correlations between the size of an individual\u2019s ethnic group at both the national and local levels and ethnic voting. Finally, ethnic voting seems to be more common, ceteris paribus, under proportional representation rules and less common under majoritarian presidential election rules.\n\n==\n\nCohen 1969:\n\nTitle: Custom and Politics in Urban Africa: A Study of Hausa Migrants in Yoruba Towns\n\nAbstract: Based on Cohen's fieldwork in the 1960s among the Hausa migrants, a people of the Yoruba area (then the western region of the Federation of Nigeria), Custom and Politics in Urban Africa looks at how ethnic groups use elements of tradition in jostling for power and privilege in new urban situations.

In particular, for every month closer their country is to a competitive presidential election, survey respondents are 1.8 percentage points more likely to identify in ethnic terms. Using an innovative multinomial logit empirical methodology, we find that these shifts are accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the salience of occupational and class identities. Our findings lend support to situational theories of social identification and are consistent with the view that ethnic identities matter in Africa for instrumental reasons: because they are useful in the competition for political power.\n\n==\n\nNathan 2016:\n\nTitle: Electoral Politics Amid Africa's Urban Transition: A Study of Urban Ghana\n\nAbstract: Africa is rapidly urbanizing. With so many African voters now living in cities, understanding African electoral politics now requires understanding the politics of urban areas. How does urbanization affect the accountability relationships between voters and politicians? Answering this question means answering a series of more specific empirical questions: what do urban voters want from the government? Which types of urban voters participate in politics and which do not? How do urban voters choose which candidates to support? How do politicians campaign in cities? Which types of urban voters do politicians seek to favor with state resources? Electoral politics in African cities received significant attention in the independence era, but little political science research has examined these cities in the contemporary democratic period. The small literature that has is largely supportive of modernization approaches. Modernization theories expect a series of socioeconomic transformations created by urbanization to reduce the political importance of ethnicity and the prevalence of clientelism and other forms of patronage-based politics. But I argue that urbanization also simultaneously creates conditions that reinforce incentives for patronage distribution, clientelism, and ethnic voting. Scarcity in the provision of basic services in contexts of low state capacity encourages politicians to continue employing patronage-based appeals. This solidifies many voters\u2019 incentives to support ethnicallyaligned parties and drives the new urban middle class away from active political participation, lowering pressure on urban politicians to engage in programmatic, policy-based competition. I explore these incentives through a detailed study of Greater Accra, the largest metropolitan area in Ghana. I combine original survey data and survey experiments, fine-grained geo-coded census data, and extensive qualitative evidence to explore voters\u2019 policy preferences, vote choices, and patterns of political\n\n==\n\nScarritt 1999:\n\nTitle: The specification of ethnic cleavages and ethnopolitical groups for the analysis of democratic competition in contemporary Africa\n\nAbstract: Ethnicity remains an important (but not the only) cost\u2010effective strategic resource for organizing collective political action in Africa's emerging democracies.

While ethnicity is generally correlated with vote choice, recent research suggests there may be less ethnic voting in cities. But I show that voting for ethnically affiliated parties is as common in some neighborhoods in urban Ghana as in rural areas, while virtually non-existent in other neighborhoods elsewhere within the same city. This intra-urban variation is not explained by differences in the salience of ethnic identities or other individual-level characteristics of voters themselves. Instead, it is influenced by the diversity and wealth of the local neighborhoods in which parties and voters interact. These neighborhood characteristics change otherwise similar voters\u2019 expectations of the benefits they will receive from an ethnically affiliated party when living in different places, producing intra-urban differences in the importance of ethnicity for vote choice.\n\n==\n\nHanna 1969:\n\nTitle: Urban dynamics in Black Africa\n\nAbstract: Abstract : Urban areas have been selected as the foci of the study because of their enormous importance to the countries in which they are located as well as to the international arena. Most urban areas of Black Africa have intensive contact with the non-African world; they provide environments which are favorable to change; and they are centers of culture, society, economy, and polity, and the hubs of the communications and transportation networks. Stylistically, the study relies heavily upon general statements concerning urban dynamics. The statements are based primarily upon a comprehensive survey of the English and French literature on urban areas and urbanization in Black Africa, as regards the patterns of urban growth, urban migration and commitment, impact of migration and town life upon the individual, urban conditions, urban ethnicity, nonethnic practices and perspectives, bases of political conflict, bases of political integration, and patterns of change.

As a result, the efforts to secure livelihood depend upon largely informalised processes and a wide range of provisional and ephemeral institutions which cultivate specific orientations toward, knowledge of, and practices for dealing with urban life. Soon, the majority of Africans will live in peri-urban and informal settlements, often at the physical and social margins of the city. Yet, marginalization from security of tenure, formal livelihood, and, frequently, participation in viable urban political institutions converges with new modalities of urban social production which frequently confound clear readings of the motivations and effects of various forms of collective action undertaken in the public sphere. \nAt the same time, African cities are sites for multifaceted development and governance interventions which make largely uninspired efforts to engage such practices and institutions. \nEven the efforts of civil society organizations operating under the umbrella of their promotion of \u2018active citizenship\u2019 tend to impose an ineffectual normative. What I attempt to do here is discuss a range of orientations to the city and an ambivalence about the city which seems to pervade how residents in many African cities use it and what they do within it. This is an ambivalence largely \nabout whether the city belongs to them, where the African city can best be made, and to what extent the city is a place for the reinvention of social solidarity or a circumvention of solidarity. \nWhile urban analysts have tended to focus on how such African cities are marginal within urban systems, the primary focus in this article is to begin, in a very provisional way, to identify strategic operations and sensibilities being put together to help African urban residents \u2018navigate\u2019 disparate positionalities within both local and global networks of power. These efforts at \nnavigation give rise to particular notions of citizenship and collective responsibility whose \u2018containment\u2019 within clearly demarcated urban identities, municipal domains, and practices of urban politics becomes increasingly problematic.", "final_summary": "The collected papers provide a rich tapestry of insights into the interplay between urban ethnicity and politics in Africa, with a particular focus on Afrobarometer data.\n\nConroy-Krutz (2009) suggests that urbanized, educated voters with access to mass media are more likely to vote across ethnic lines, indicating a shift from parochial to global identities.

The first study examines the impact of urbanization on electoral politics, suggesting that urbanization creates conditions that reinforce incentives for patronage distribution, clientelism, and ethnic voting.

The influence of ethnicity on voting behavior can vary within the same city, influenced by factors such as neighborhood diversity and wealth. Ethnic identities are also strengthened by political competition, and ethnicity remains a key strategic resource in Africa's emerging democracies.

When the transmissions from one reader interfere with the operation of another reader, a reader collision occurs. The objective of the reader collision problem is to minimize the reader collisions experienced by RFID readers while using the minimum number of frequencies and using the minimum total time for all readers to communicate successfully. HiQ attempts to minimize reader collisions by learning the collision patterns of the readers and by effectively assigning frequencies over time to ensure neighboring readers do not experience collisions from one another. HiQ is arranged hierarchically with distributed, local control. The algorithm is based on a type of reinforcement learning called Q-learning, which is used to determine frequency and time assignments. Through repeated interaction with the system, Q-learning attempts to discover an optimum frequency assignment over time. We show that HiQ finds optimal or near optimal solutions to the reader collision problem.\n\n==\n\nCowell 2004:\n\nTitle: The Human-Information Workspace (HI-Space): Ambient Table Top Entertainment\n\nAbstract: This paper introduces the Human Information Workspace (HI-Space) as a test-bed for evaluating new information exploration mechanisms.

This literature accuses science journalists of inaccuracy, sensationalism, oversimplification and failing to engage audiences in meaningful debate about scientific issues. However, research has yet to offer concrete solutions to journalists that connect theory to practice in an effort to counter these criticisms. In this paper, we approach this gap through the development of clearly articulated models of science journalism that are supported by theoretical considerations of the varying purposes of science communication, and then, importantly, tied to practical story development criteria. Four models are presented: science literacy, contextual, lay-expertise and public participation. These models are clear representations of how science journalism can be produced from within different theoretical frameworks and thereby provide a theoretically-informed but practical guide for nuanced evaluations of the quality of science journalism.\n\n==\n\nVadapalli 2018:\n\nTitle: Sci-Blogger: A Step Towards Automated Science Journalism\n\nAbstract: Science journalism is the art of conveying a detailed scientific research paper in a form that non-scientists can understand and appreciate while ensuring that its underlying information is conveyed accurately.

Compared to a decade ago, this occupational group, driven by economic imperatives and technological changes, is performing a wider plurality of roles, including those of curator, convener, public intellectual and civic educator, in addition to more traditional journalistic roles of reporter, conduit, watchdog and agenda-setter.

On this template, science is portrayed as groundless, incomprehensible, didactic truth statements from scientists, who themselves are socially powerful, arbitrary, unelected authority figures. They are detached from reality; they do work that is either whacky or dangerous, but either way, everything in science is tenuous, contradictory, probably going to change soon and, most ridiculously, \u2018hard to understand.\u2019 Having created this parody, the commentariat then attack it, as if they were genuinely critiquing what science is all about.

Scripps and William E. Ritter joined to form a science news organization dedicated to pioneering the dissemination of accurate, accessible, and engaging news of science to the public primarily through the mainstream media. Scripps, a longtime journalist and successful entrepreneur, and Ritter, a respected biologist and teacher, were convinced of the importance of science knowledge to the American public. They also were concerned about limits and abuses under other political systems where science research was abridged or threatened. They sought to create a \"scientific habit of mind\" among the general public to increase the average person's awareness of the role of science in his or her daily life, to gain support for science research, and to help protect American democracy through an intelligent\u2014meaning scienceeducated\u2014citizenry. The result of this collaboration was the organization Science Service, established in 1921 for the popularization of science, with the support and participation of the leading science organizations, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, National Academy of Science, and the National Research Council, as well as leaders of the journalism community. Reaching the public also meant navigating the contentious relationship between scientists and the press to create new ways of translating science information, and overcoming scientists' reticence about sharing their research interests with the lay public. Additionally, Science Service weighed capturing the public's attention through enticing but only fact-tinged stories, versus adhering to higher scientific and journalistic standards of fact-based but less sensational articles.

In doing so, we outline three complementary approaches to what Thomas Patterson calls \u201cknowledge-based journalism.\u201d By way of these approaches, journalists and their news organizations can contextualize and critically evaluate expert knowledge; facilitate discussion that bridges entrenched ideological divisions; and promote consideration of a broader menu of policy options and technologies.

While science journalists established their own professional routines and standards, different actors (and scientists in particular) often criticise science journalism for not being transparent and accurate enough. One critical point raised concerns journalists\u2019 representation of scientific evidence. Against this background, the current study investigated which kind of information about scientific evidence is represented in science articles in German print and online media. The results of a quantitative content analysis (N\u2009=\u2009128), in which variables were coded for the represented scientific results (N\u2009=\u2009225), showed that scientific evidence is rarely part of science articles, and scientific findings are predominantly depicted as scientifically certain. However, information about uncertainty is more common within sections in the media specifically dedicated to science, as well as when the article has natural scientific or medical scientific content. In addition, the scientific results that are presented first in an article contain the most information about scientific evidence.\n\n==\n\nPolman 2014:\n\nTitle: Adapting Practices of Science Journalism to Foster Science Literacy\n\nAbstract: In this paper, the authors describe how the practices of expert science journalists enable them to act as \u201ccompetent outsiders\u201d to science. We assert that selected science journalism practices can be used to design reform-based science instruction; these practices not only foster science literacy that is useful in daily life, but also complement practices of scientists that already have been incorporated into science education. We describe and illustrate science journalism practices for educational activities that can be adapted and used. We argue that such experiences enable students to better use science information for personal decision-making and help them contribute meaningfully to public discourse long after high school graduation. Finally, we describe the design of a learning environment that facilitates research and development based on this model.", "final_summary": "Science journalism, a critical bridge between the scientific community and the public, has evolved significantly over the years, adapting to technological advancements and changing societal needs. \n\nSecko (2013) proposed four models of science journalism: science literacy, contextual, lay-expertise, and public participation. These models provide a theoretical framework for producing science journalism that addresses criticisms of inaccuracy, sensationalism, and oversimplification. \n\nIn the digital age, science journalism has taken on new roles and practices. Fahy (2011) found that online science journalists are performing a wider plurality of roles, including curator, convener, public intellectual, and civic educator. \n\nAutomation is another emerging trend in science journalism. Vadapalli (2018) introduced the concept of automating parts of the science journalism workflow, such as generating blog titles for scientific papers. \n\nHistorically, science journalism has played a crucial role in promoting science literacy. Bennet (2013) discussed the origins of science journalism and its mission to create a \"scientific habit of mind\" among the general public. Polman (2014) suggested that practices of expert science journalists can be adapted for science education to foster science literacy. \n\nHowever, science journalism also faces challenges. Guenther (2017) pointed out that science journalism often fails to accurately represent scientific evidence, leading to criticisms about transparency and accuracy. Nisbet (2015) argued for the need for \"knowledge-based journalism\" in politicized science debates, suggesting that journalists can play a crucial role as influential knowledge professionals. \n\nIn conclusion, science journalism has evolved from a conduit of scientific information to a multifaceted field that encompasses education, public participation, and even automation. Despite facing challenges in accurately representing scientific evidence, it continues to adapt and innovate to meet the changing needs of society (Secko, 2013; Vadapalli, 2018; Fahy, 2011; Bennet, 2013; Polman, 2014; Guenther, 2017; Nisbet, 2015)."}]
